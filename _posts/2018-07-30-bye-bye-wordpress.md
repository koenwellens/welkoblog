### Why the big change?
Because I've had two blogs for quite some time now. There's <a href="https://readingwithwelko.wordpress.com/">my reading blog</a>, where I review books and discuss other book-ish matters, and there's <a href="https://welkoiswriting.wordpress.com/">my writing blog</a>, where I talk about writing and try to post short stories whenever possible. So as you may or may not know, I am maintaining two blogs at the moment.

And that just makes no sense. Why would I keep you away from content? Instead, I want feedback and opinions. So it's in my interest to get as much content as possible over to you! One blog to rule them all, that's the idea.

### But why leave Wordpress?
I found out a few weeks ago about <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Basically, it's a way of creating a website more programmatically. Wordpress has a lot of features out of the box, but you either have to pay for the good ones or host your own Wordpress. Until now, I have done neither of the two.

What does this change for you? Not a lot. If you follow this blog via <b>Wordpress Reader</b>, you can also register my new blog there. No worries! If you come by via <a href="https://twitter.com/wel_ko"><b>Twitter</b></a> or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29067301"><b>Goodreads</b></a>, there's also no issue. I'll put links to the new blog from now on.Â 

### "Enough already! Where is this new blog you speak of?"
Before you go, please know that I really appreciate feedback. If you want to share your views on layout or content, please do so. Just leave a comment on a post or let me know via the contacts form. The new blog has already changed a lot in the one week it's been online.

Without further due, here it is:
