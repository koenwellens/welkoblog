title: 'Review: Matthew Syed - Black Box Thinking'
description: "I can enjoy a good non-fiction book. After reading great works like Leadership and Self-Deception and Innovation Games, I always try to keep my eyes open for other great self-improvement publications. I found one in <em>Black Box Thinking: Why Some People Never Learn from Their Mistakes &#8211; But Some Do</em>."

As the author explains, <em>Black Box Thinking</em> is not about thinking about certain things as &#8216;black boxes&#8217;, things that we don&#8217;t know (or want to know) the internals from. Instead, it&#8217;s an analogy to the aviation sector, where black boxes are used to learn and improve the flight processes.

Matthew Syed brings up examples in a way that many fiction artists are jealous of. He builds his story perfectly and brings up tension in the right places. What&#8217;s even better, next to the many examples he tells a story about himself. How Matthew himself is human and thus susceptible to making mistakes.

I agree with Matthew Syed. If you want, I can explain the contents in great detail but I don&#8217;t want to spoil the book for you. I think it&#8217;s best if you read it for yourself! Please do so. This is a ✩✩✩✩✩ book. World class!
