title: 'Review: Alastair Reynolds - Revenger'
description: 'Another month in this warm Spring, so time for another themed book! Space, wasn&#8217;t it? Ha! You&#8217;re right it was! So what book is a good space book? I settled with <em>Revenger</em>, an Alastair Reynolds novel that was published in 2016. How was it? Worth reading? Enough waiting. Here&#8217;s my review!'

This book starts with space mumbo jumbo. Lots of it. There&#8217;s not so much explanation either, but maybe I&#8217;m not really used to it yet. You get the explanation as the story progresses. Then, the space mumbo jumbo transforms to pirate space mumbo jumbo. Pirates&#8230; in space.



Overall, the plot is good. That makes up a lot. But this book mainly builds up for a next story. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s sad about this story. There is a lot of potential, but it becomes clear about halfway through how it&#8217;s going to end, and the last part is more build-up then closure of the story.

For me, this is a ✩✩✩ book. I still enjoyed it, after I got used to the space mumbo jumbo. But in the end it wasn&#8217;t great. Maybe the second one will be better!
