Have you not read &#8211; or listened actually, because it&#8217;s only released as an audiobook &#8211; the book? Then you might want to wait with reading this review. There is a spoiler coming up.

What I like about the series, is the constant humour that plagues the characters. Stereotypes, computer science, female emancipation: all of these are part of the jokes in these books. And that continues in <em>Fight and Flight</em>.

Even though the book was funny and surely had its moments, I didn&#8217;t enjoy it as much as I&#8217;ve had the previous instalments of the series. The main reason (<b>spoiler here</b>) is that there is no real enemy in this book. The wizards are fighting themselves, really. The antagonists of the previous books were so good, that I&#8217;ve missed them in this one.

The ending of the book is a real Scott Meyer ending. If you&#8217;ve read one of the other Magic 2.0 books, you&#8217;ll know what I mean! That ending, and my liking of the previous books, still make me look out for the next part of Martin&#8217;s adventures in Medieval England.

I ended up rating this book 3 stars. I was let down by the absence of an antagonist and that hung for the entire book. Knowing Scott Meyer, he&#8217;ll be able to make a better instalment for the series next time. At least I&#8217;m still looking forward to it.

Have you read &#8211; or listened to &#8211; <em>Fight and Flight</em>? What did you think of it? Luke Daniels is a beast, right? Leave a response in the comments section!
