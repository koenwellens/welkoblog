title: "Review: Iain Reid - I'm Thinking of Ending Things"
description: 'I&#8217;m starting to run into problems. Of the books I read, most of them are chosen at a monthly rate. I mostly put the books aside that I&#8217;m going to read in the next month. When I run out of books, I pick them off my to-read list. My <em>very long</em> to-read list. Many times, I can&#8217;t choose!'

And so I find books that have been on that list for a long time. Like <em>I&#8217;m Thinking of Ending Things</em>. This one had gotten on my list because Goodreads has tagged it as a horror book. As a fan of the genre, I had to read it. Here&#8217;s my review!

I started this book without any expectations. Like I said, I mostly needed just something to read. From the first sentence, I was into the story. <em>I&#8217;m Thinking of Ending Things</em>. It was really hard to put down this book at times. In the beginning it was okay, but near the end I was so gripped by it. I had to finish it to know what was going on!

Even though you don&#8217;t know a lot about the narrator, you soon get this &#8220;watch out, girl&#8221; feeling. You&#8217;re really living the life she&#8217;s leading. The story builds up to a point where the author punches you in the face. Or at least, that&#8217;s the feeling you get. Well done, Iain Reid. Well done.

This book is worth 4 stars for me. Especially the ending. I loved it. I had the urge to re-read the book instantly. That doesn&#8217;t happen much. Now I&#8217;m really looking forward to what more Iain Reid has to offer. Can&#8217;t wait to read again!
