Here are the eleven(!) books I&#8217;ve read in January, as well as my February goal!

## Coaching for Performance

I started reading <em>Coaching for Performance</em> in December already. On the train, it was a nice book about training. Haha, I love that joke. The late John Whitmore wrote a great book here. I found it in the library of my work, and I&#8217;m very happy I read it.

Anybody who wants to coach people, should really read this book. It describes a framework on helping your coachee grow. Whitmore helps you at asking the right questions and providing the right guidance. Read this book and let me know: are you a better coach now?

## The 8-Minute Writing Habit

I&#8217;ve read my first book about writing in a long time. It&#8217;s a dream I&#8217;ve had for so many years that I haven&#8217;t yet lived. But it&#8217;s something that I want. So I read <em>The 8-Minute Writing Habit</em>. This book is supposed to help you get a writing habit by, you&#8217;ve guessed it, advising you to write at least 8 minutes per day.

Monica Leonelle does her best to help you create a habit. And it works. Since I&#8217;ve read this book, I&#8217;ve written 15 minutes every day. Maybe I&#8217;ve skipped it once, but I&#8217;ve also gone for more than 15 minutes on other days. So this book really helps! If you want to create a writing habit, read this. Let me know what you think of it!

## Six of Crows

<em>Six of Crows</em> is a fantasy story about a bunch of young adults attempting the greatest theft of their time and place. There are books that can grab you by the first page. This one wasn&#8217;t one of those. Yet, this book received immensely good reviews. So I read on. And the last two chapters were great. They made it worth the read. I&#8217;m going to read the follow-up story. It&#8217;s just not so high on my priority list.

## The Joy of Pi

Can a book about mathematics be fun? Can it even be interesting? That is what a lot of people ask me when I tell them I read <em>The Joy of Pi</em>. The answer is simply yes. This book <em>is</em> fun. It <em>is</em> interesting. I even learnt some new things, even though I have a mathematical background.

What David Blatner does great with this book, is provide you small facts and fun stories about the most researched number in history. Why is <em>Pi</em> so special? What are odd things about it? Answers to those questions can be found in the book. I mean it, try it out. Math might not be so dull as you think!

## Side Jobs

Ah. Harry Dresden. So we meet again! It&#8217;s been a while. I&#8217;ve read the entire series in 2016, starting at book one and ending at book 15. When I was done, I put this book on my to-read list. But I never got to it. I think it was mostly because the stories take place between books 10 and 13. And I was already further. But it was time to relive the magical wonders of Harry. And I&#8217;m glad I did.

The only wizard in the yellow pages has some short stories that give you a lot more background for certain characters. Like his brother or his friend Murphy. A necessary read if you&#8217;re a fan of the series, like me. A good read as well. If you&#8217;re a Harry Dresden fan, be sure to read this book. If you&#8217;re interested, you might want to begin with <em>Storm Front</em>. Let me know when you do!

## Writing Fight Scenes

After <em>The 8-Minute Writing Habit</em> was a success for me, I decided to take my dream of a writing career one step further. With <em>Writing Fight Scenes</em> I could get some tips on, well, how to write fight scenes. How to describe a punch or stab. That kind of stuff. I was not disappointed.

The main reason why I read this book is because Rayne Hall has written a number of writer-help books. This was her very first. It seemed like a great place to start. And I liked it. I&#8217;m thinking of writing an example fight scene just to show what this book taught me. If you&#8217;re writing a book but struggling with your fight scenes, be sure to check out this book. It&#8217;s worth it!

## Play at Work

Except for <em>Coaching for Performance</em>, which I started in December 2017, I hadn&#8217;t really read any work-related things yet. As I&#8217;m a fan of gamification, I found this book and assumed it would be about the subject. Spoiler alert: it wasn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s more a collection on how some companies have used gamification instead of the failsafe guide to implementing it yourself. The latter is what I was looking for.

## I&#8217;m Thinking of Ending Things

Sometimes we find books that really trigger something in us. Sometimes it&#8217;s happiness, other times we feel sad. <em>I&#8217;m Thinking of Ending Things</em> gives you strange feelings. Like, WTF just happened kind-of feelings. I was very, <em>very</em> happy that I read this book.

If you&#8217;re a fan of horror stories, psychological mindfucks and that kind of things, this book is perfect for you! At the end of <em>I&#8217;m Thinking of Ending Things</em>, you&#8217;ll be like: wow. A job well done, Iain Reid. If you&#8217;re a horror fan, read this book. Let me know your thoughts about it!

## Gamification by Design

I spent a whole day on a train, not knowing what to do. I could listen to my audiobook for five hours, but I didn&#8217;t feel like it. Instead, I found this e-book on gamification. A <em>real</em> book on gamification! Would I find out the path to a great gamification design? The title sure looks promising, right?

<em>Gamification by Design</em> does live up to my expectations. After reading it, I have a great idea on what I need to gamify certain parts of my job, my personal life or just random things in life I notice. It opened up a whole new way of thinking for me. It can do the same for you too, if you give it a try. I&#8217;m curious what you make of it!

## Brilliance

For some reason, I had already stumbled by Marcus Sakey in the past. But I&#8217;d never read his books. I was running short on books to read. So I did what any man in my situation would do: I randomly picked one. <em>Brilliance</em> was the winner of my story lottery. After reading the book, I have the feeling that I was the winner!

Sakey does a great job with this first book of the Brilliance Saga. I immediately want to read the second book. You can expect a review of it in February. I&#8217;m very happy to have read this first part and I&#8217;m quite sure the other parts will be just as good. Or even better. I might be a bit biased by Goodreads rating when saying that. Pick up this book if you want a good action book!

## The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck

Mark Manson gives a quick overview of his life in his bestselling book <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</em>. His advice: stop giving so many fucks. Don&#8217;t get it? Read the book. It&#8217;s really well written. If you get over the bluntness Manson uses in the beginning of the book, you&#8217;ll notice that you really start to like his style of writing. If you got some priority issues or just want to read a good book, here&#8217;s your deal! Go read!

## What&#8217;s Next? February 2018

I might need to refine my reading goal this year. I wanted to read 60 books. I&#8217;ve already finished 11&#8230; So I&#8217;m going to be fair with you: I won&#8217;t play safe. I could say that I&#8217;ll read 5 books next month and surely reach that goal. But I&#8217;ll go for some more. Because what&#8217;s a challenge if it&#8217;s not challenging, right? My goal for February: 8 books! Here are some candidates.

So, how do these books fit my new year&#8217;s resolutions? <em>Change Agent</em> has a blue cover, so it fits my winter theme. <em>A Better World</em> and <em>Hellbent</em> both are part of a series. Check! A lot of the books above are stand-alone and many are non-fiction. That meets the requirements!

I&#8217;m really looking forward to February. Can I keep this rate up? I have my doubts&#8230; but that doesn&#8217;t mean I won&#8217;t try. How about you? What did you read in January? Let me know via Twitter or by leaving a comment!
