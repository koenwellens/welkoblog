title: 'Review: Peter Clines - Ex-Patriots'
description: '<em>Ex-Heroes</em> is a series written by Peter Clines. I started reading the second instalment, <em>Ex-Patriots</em>, a few months after reading its predecessor <em>Ex-Heroes</em>. Protagonists in this series are superheroes who fight in a real zombocalypse. It&#8217;s mostly described as a mix of The Avengers and The Walking Dead. The series is great, fun and reads quickly. Here&#8217;s my review of the second book, <em>Ex-Patriots</em>.'

## Brief Recap

Eight months after the events of <em>Ex-Heroes</em>, the surviving superheroes of L.A. are doing their best to keep the lives of all humans in The Mount as good as possible. Under the circumstances, of course. Outside the walls, ex-humans are still walking around. They clack their teeth constantly. The only fun the sentries are having these days, is finding former celebrities that are walking around Hollywood as ex-es. And when they find them, kill them to get the most points.

During a mission, Saint George and some scavengers notice an automated airplane to fly over them. Zzzap, who can apparently also receive radio signals, notifies the people steering the drone of their existence via the radio&#8217;s frequencies. Not long after that, a team of supersoldiers shows up at The Mount to save the day. These soldiers participated in a military project, Krypton, that turned them into superhumans.

After a misstart, with a climax of Saint George throwing punches with Captain Freedom, the army invites Stealth and Saint George over at their base. They are interested in the Cerberus armour and so Dr. Danielle Morris also joins the superheroes to the base. But soon they find out that the army might not be so trustworthy as they sound.

## Characters to Keep an Eye on

Here&#8217;s a list of characters you&#8217;ll follow throughout the book.

  * Saint George, who used to be a hero known as The Mighty Dragon, is the major protagonist of the series. He changed his name as all he wants to do, is do right for all other humans. He has super strength, can fly and breathe fire.
  * Zzzap is the energy form of Barry Burke. Barry, who lives in a wheelchair because of pre-plague injuries, can become a jolt of energy that is held together by his conscience. He can shoot bolts of lightning and fly at super high speed. And he is super funny.
  * Stealth is the leader of The Mount. As I&#8217;ve read around the internet, she is often compared to Batman which is also pointed out by Saint George in the series. Nobody knows how she looks like behind her masks, but she is great at creeping up on people. She&#8217;s a weapon expert and a trained mercenary.
  * John Smith works for the government. It is he who gets project Krypton back on track. He is often forgotten and goes around unnoticed. He dated Dr. Morris for a while before the Ex-virus outbreak and is still obsessed by the Cerberus armour.
  * Cesar Mendoza is an ex-17. He&#8217;s not an ex-human, but used to live with the 17&#8217;s before the events of <em>Ex-Heroes</em>. He lives in The Mount now, where he shows Saint George that he used to be known as The Driver. His superpower allows him to merge with vehicles and control them as if they are his body.

My <b>Favourite</b> characters in this book are The Driver and Zzzap. Zzzap is really funny in the first half of the book, while Cesar gets his book-time in the second half. They are both really cool characters.

## My Two Cents

I liked the first instalment of the series, because it was a new and cool concept. Superheroes were fighting off thousands of zombies that rushed them in Los Angeles. It was a standalone book. I didn&#8217;t know how the second book of the series would be and was happy I got the chance to find out.

<em>Ex-Patriots</em> shows that the series is far from over. The end of the book leaves room for a few more storylines. New characters are introduced, new friends are found and new enemies are made. And then there&#8217;s _Legion_. I really love how Peter Clines introduced him. Really, read the book and tell me what you think of it.

## Conclusion

Even though I had a good laugh when reading this book and I really enjoyed it, I cannot rate it 5 stars. The book wasn&#8217;t as good as <em>The Fireman</em>. So I have to rate <em>Ex-Patriots</em> lower. In my opinion, it deserves 4 stars. The book has a lot of great elements: a nice buildup, funny characters, a strong plot. There&#8217;s room for more events in this ex-universe. And I think they will be great.
