### Missed Opportunities
There are three unfinished books that I mentioned last time. <em>Station Eleven</em> and <em>The Devourer</em> are two books I didn't get to start yet. I did start <em>The Plot Whisperer</em>, but I'm only one quarter in yet. Instead, I read <em>Black Box Thinking</em> and I started Stephen King's latest, <em>The Outsider</em>.

### The Crooked Staircase
I started the month reading <em>The Crooked Staircase</em>. This is the third book of the Jane Hawk series. If you want to read this one, it's advised that you read the first two books of the series. You better do, because they're a lot better than this one.

I liked <em>The Crooked Staircase</em> a lot less than its predecessors. I have wondered why I've actually read the second book, as this one hardly uses the information from it. All in all, the concept is still nice. I'm looking forward to book four!

### How to Win Friends and Influence People
Up next was the oldest book I've ever read. <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> was first published in 1936. While I was sceptic in the beginning, I'm quite happy that I read the book.

There might be too much content in this book, making it slow to read from time to time. Apart from that, it really is a great read. You should try it. Just wait and see, you'll enjoy it!

### The Secrets of Supervillainy
My theme for the summer is superheroes. I'm reading a series about just that! Thought I'd read another book from it. But just like with the Jane Hawk series, the third book of the Supervillainy Saga was not as good as its predecessors. 

<img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1519562155l/38742798.jpg" class="monthly-summary-summary">

<em>The Secrets of Supervillainy</em> continues the adventures of Merciless. It's a bad story. The ending just feels a bit hasty. The author, C.J. Phipps also said in a Tweet to me that he's man enough to admit the book deserved a better ending. I'm still going to read book four!

### Black Box Thinking
A book that wasn't on my list, is <em>Black Box Thinking</em>. A few pages into the book and I already saw this book being mentioned by someone I follow on Twitter. And she liked it. I can surely say now that I haven't regretted any page. There are a lot of useful life lessons in this book! If you're going to read a book from this summary, this is the one I most recommend.

### So Not a Hero
Last and probably least, there was <em>So Not a Hero</em>. It's another superhero story that provides an origin story of the newest superheroine in town. I thought it'd be a good idea not to focus only on the Supervillainy Saga. The plan on itself was good. The outcome a lot less.

I didn't enjoy this book as much as I'd hoped. There are certainly good parts here, but there are a lot of things that bothered me. The worst was the sexism. There was too much of that for me.

### What's Next? August 2018
I have learnt from the past. August is holiday period, and during holidays I read less than planned. So I'm not going to make my reading goal as high as last time.

What's in here? Well I'm going to finish the books I'm currently reading: <em>The Outsider</em> and <em>The Plot Whisperer</em>. That's already one book part of a series and a non-fiction book. The latter is even a stand-alone book. I need one about superheroes as well, which is where <em>The Science of Supervillainy</em> comes in. I'm also very interested in <em>Out of Spite, Out of Mind</em>. It's the latest Magic 2.0 book! And I also want to read <em>Accelerate</em>. Heard a lot of good things about it!

So my goal for August is <b>six</b> books. Let's try to do that! Have you set a reading goal? What is it? And what did you read in June? Let me know, I'm curious!
