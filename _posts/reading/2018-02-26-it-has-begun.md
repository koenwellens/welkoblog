It has begun.

For the first time since many years, I&#8217;ve written fiction. At least, more than a few sentences.

Today I&#8217;ve written 2366 words. Is it a chapter? Is it a short story? What is it?

It&#8217;s the outline for a story. I have the characters. I know what will happen. I think it&#8217;s time.

Let&#8217;s do this!

Expect more news. Soon&#8230;
