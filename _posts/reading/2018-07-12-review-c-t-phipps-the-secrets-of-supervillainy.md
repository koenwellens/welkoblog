There&#8217;s a lot more time between this third book of the series and its predecessor. Which is okay. Some things happen off-screen &#8211; if you can talk about a screen here &#8211; and that&#8217;s okay as well. The sad part is that the story takes a long time to really get interesting. There&#8217;s some time catching up for what you can&#8217;t read, but then there&#8217;s just a long time of nothing really happening.

The ending of the book gets a lot better. And when you&#8217;re at the edge of your seat&#8230; the book ends. Not the story though. I guess that&#8217;s okay, as the complete story would probably turn into a 600 page book&#8230; But the last battle was over before it started. A missed opportunity.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I still really like Merciless, his humor and his sidekicks. The points above are just things I noticed while reading. I think, of the three books I&#8217;ve read now in The Supervillain Saga, <em>The Secrets of Supervillainy</em> is probably the least good one. A ✩✩✩ book. Not bad, but I liked the previous two books more. Oh well. There&#8217;s a fourth book to make up for this!
