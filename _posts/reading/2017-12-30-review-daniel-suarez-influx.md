description: 'Wow. I just finished my 51st book of 2017. Holy cow. I can&#8217;t believe that number! After _How Google Works_, I thought I&#8217;d start reading <em>Influx</em> and see. Quite sure I&#8217;d finish it next month. And now BAM, it&#8217;s done! Get ready for my last review of 2017. Crap, now I got to revise my previous post about my 2017 in books. Oh well, here&#8217;s my view on <em>Influx</em> by Daniel Suarez.'

The beginning of this book was tough. The first chapter contained so much technological terms and scientific explanation, I almost put this book down. But after that, the story got a lot better. Things were more down-to-earth again. The story is still unbelievable, but that doesn&#8217;t make it a bad story.

<em>Influx</em> is about Jon Grady, a brilliant man who makes a life-changing invention. At least, life-changing for him. He then masters to overpower Artificial Intelligences that outsmart any human, and fight of a bureau of brilliant guys just like him. You can probably see where the story gets unbelievable, right?

What I liked especially about this book is that it explores the idea of a government agency, the Bureau of Technology Control, seizing technologies that can help humanity. They even hint at a solution for cancer that exists. One of my book ideas, right there. Awesome!

When you&#8217;re into this story, it&#8217;s really fun. When we loose the technical mumbo jumbo of the first chapter &#8211; which you&#8217;ll forget anyway &#8211; this book leaves you with a cool story. I rate this book 4 stars. It&#8217;s a fun read. Try it out!
