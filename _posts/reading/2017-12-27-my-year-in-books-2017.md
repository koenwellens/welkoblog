## The numbers

My reading challenge this year was set to 35 books. I nailed it. Big time! An awesome amount of **51** books is the overachievement I have this year. This high number is definitely a better performance than my reading achievements of 2016, when only 31 books were on my list.

Even though I&#8217;ve read a lot more books than in 2016, the number of pages didn&#8217;t rise that much. The past year, **16,951** pages were turned by my hands. That&#8217;s only 3,500 more pages than the year before. Then, I had gone through 13,354 pages. This seems to indicate that the books I&#8217;ve read in 2016 had more pages than the ones in 2017. It sure didn&#8217;t feel like that to me!

In the image above, you can see some statistics about the ratings I&#8217;ve given in 2017 and 2016. Apparently I read more books that I liked less. I&#8217;d like to note here that I read the entire <em>Dresden Files</em> series in 2016 and that I absolutely loved them. Goodreads too, as you can see on the image. But damn, look at that. I&#8217;m pulling the rating of <em>Weaving the Web</em> down. I only rated it 3 stars and it still has a 4.29 average. Amazing!

## The books

Last year was the first year that I actually started rating the books. 2017 is the year that I started writing reviews. That was a whole journey and I&#8217;ll surely give you some more info on that later this year! I&#8217;ve read a lot of series and non-fiction books this year. Here&#8217;s a small overview.

I read all of the <em>Ex-Heroes</em> series by Peter Clines. He recently hinted that he&#8217;s writing a sixth instalment. Yay! There was <em>Orphan X</em> and the <em>Tim Rackley</em> series by Gregg Hurwitz. I&#8217;m really looking forward to the third book of the <em>Orphan X</em> series. It looks so awesome! Another series that was great was the <em>Magic 2.0</em> series by Scott Meyer. And I can&#8217;t forget the <em>Bill Hodges</em> trilogy from my all-time favourite author Stephen King.

There were many non-fiction books and standalone books as well. I&#8217;m not going through all of them here, but I&#8217;m sure you can find them on your own. Below are some pictures to help you in your search!

So what standalone books were there? There was <em>Paradox Bound</em> by Peter clines and <em>Hex</em> by Thomas Olde Heuvelt. These were really awesome. But what I enjoyed most this year were the Arbinger institute books. These helped me in my professional career and improved my view on life drastically.

Above this paragraph, you will find the complete list of books that I&#8217;ve read in 2017. The year was about to end with </em>How Google Works</em>. It&#8217;s an interesting view on one of the biggest companies of the last decades. It is intriguing to see the mindset and way of working Googlers experience. It opens up your perspective. And then I amazed myself and finished <em>Influx</em>. A fun techno-thriller. Look it up!

## Expectations for 2018

What books will 2018 bring? I&#8217;m not completely sure yet. I&#8217;m thinking about setting the reading challenge to 60. Or at least 55. But I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ll invest some more time in books that got left behind this year. And read some amazing pieces. Like the following.

  * <em>Hellbent</em> by Gregg Hurwitz. The third book of the <em>Orphan X</em> series. I can hardly wait!
  * Some non-fiction books related to my job.
  * <em>The Whispering Room</em> by Dean Koontz, which is the second book of the <em>Jane Hawk</em> trilogy.
  * Some non-fiction books related to my hobbies.
  * <em>Peace Talks</em> by Jim Butcher, maybe? If he finishes it this year&#8230; Keep it up, Jim!
