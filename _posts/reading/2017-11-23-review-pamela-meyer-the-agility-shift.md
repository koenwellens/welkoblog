As the title suggests, this book is about agile. For someone who has some background on the subject, there wasn&#8217;t much new in this book. But that isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing. The book introduces the concepts and has the focus on changing mindsets.

I have struggled to get through this book. The last chapters felt more like a sales pitch for improv lessons. As if the author was sponsored by an improv tutor. Though I understand what she was going for, it kind of ruined the book for me. It&#8217;s not a bad book and can certainly help people towards the right mindset.

I was excited to read this book. In the end I got let down, understanding why the book does not have the high rating other books about the topic receive. I rate this book 3 stars. This book is worth the read if you know nothing about agile, but I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it to fellow agilists.
