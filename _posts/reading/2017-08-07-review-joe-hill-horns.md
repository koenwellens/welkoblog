description: 'I am a fan of Joe Hill&#8217;s work. I&#8217;ve had some plans on reading his books even before I read <em>The Fireman</em>. So it was about time I got to read <em>Horns</em>. And while I didn&#8217;t really have very high hopes, I was curious for this book that has turned into a movie as well. Here&#8217;s my review of the story.'

This book surprised me. I read other Joe Hill books before, so I knew what he was capable of. Still, this story is so psychologically cruel&#8230; How I like it best! Ig Perrish has so much bad luck and goes through such bad, _real_, experiences. It&#8217;s hard to believe he didn&#8217;t go insane. Or maybe he did.

Of course, there were parts in this book I didn&#8217;t like. There&#8217;s a lot of build-up near the beginning, which I think is too much. I think they were just meant to fill the book, which is sad. There were some parts that are mystical, but there&#8217;s not so much explanation about it. Hill could have done better, in my opinion.

Near the end of the book I was convinced once again that Joe Hill is a great talent, just like his father. I expect many more great books from him. Really, <em>Horns</em> is a great book. My rating for this book is 4 stars, and I advice many people to read it. It&#8217;s really worth it!

Have you read <em>Horns</em>? What did you think about Ig&#8217;s story? Let me know in the comments section!
