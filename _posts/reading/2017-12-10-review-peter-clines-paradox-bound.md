title: 'Review: Peter Clines - Paradox Bound'
description: 'This year I&#8217;ve said it a lot. And yes, I have read a lot of books from authors that I like. Peter Clines is one of them. I am a fan of the <em>Ex-Heroes</em> series and his other connected multi-verse books. So naturally, I was excited when I heard he was writing a book about time travel. I was really looking forward to this book!'

I <b>love</b> the idea behind the story of this book. It is a time travel, mystery and suspense novel all in one. And the story is put together really well. I was already a fan of Clines, but now I&#8217;m even more into his books. For those that know him from his other novels, there&#8217;s a small reference to zombies in this one and even a cool reference to the multi-verse. Can you spot it?

So, will I recommend this book to people? Yes! Did I absolutely love this book? No. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I meant it when I said I love the <b>idea</b> behind the story. The ending just let me down a little. Although I know the ending, some things were not made explicit. And that would not have been a shame. Now it&#8230; kind of was.

In his afterword, Peter Clines mentioned that there might be a follow-up story regarding Harry&#8217;s parents. Mr. Clines, if you&#8217;re listening: I&#8217;m looking forward to it! And to your next <em>Ex-Heroes</em> book&#8230; And to your next multi-verse book&#8230;

I rate this book 4 stars! Which means I totally liked it! But was let down by something. What&#8217;s your opinion? Have you read <em>Paradox Bound</em>? What are your thoughts on the story? Let me know in a comment near the bottom of this post!
