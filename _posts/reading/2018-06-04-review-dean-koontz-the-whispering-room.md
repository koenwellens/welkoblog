Fast-paced action! That&#8217;s what you get when you read this book. Koontz is a master of suspense. Before you get a chance to process what&#8217;s going on, you&#8217;re hit with another assault on Jane. By the time when she finally sits down for a few pages, she&#8217;ll be in a restaurant keeping ladies safe from murderers.

The only bad thing about this book might be the ending. It might be a bit anti-climactic. But still this is a great book. And there&#8217;s a third out already! And a fourth on the way! Hurray!

I liked <em>The Whispering Room</em> a lot. It made me think of Orphan X. Of course, this is a different level. Jane Hawk is not at the level of Orphan X. But she&#8217;s getting there. This book is definitely worth ✩✩✩✩✩ stars!
