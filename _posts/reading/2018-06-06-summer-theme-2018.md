### &#8230; books about <em>superheroes</em>!

Now, I am <b>really</b> happy. If there&#8217;s one thing I like more than science fiction or suspense, it&#8217;s a good superhero story. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed the theme in the past. The <em>Ex-Heroes</em> series by Peter Clines was a good way to reintroduce me to the book genre.

So the first book I&#8217;ll read in this theme is <em>The Rules of Supervillainy</em>!

In the next month, you&#8217;ll see more superhero books. Stay tuned for my autumn theme, which I&#8217;ll reveal in September&#8230;
