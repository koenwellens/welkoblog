title: 'Review: Sheryl Sandberg & Adam Grant - Option B'
description: 'Wow. This is going to be short post. I don&#8217;t know how I got this book on my list, but it surely was not what I had expected. It&#8217;s written by the COO of Facebook, together with a friend who happens to have written some books of his own. Here&#8217;s my review.'

I read the introduction, and then I felt like I knew everything this book had to give. I read the first part of chapter one and then I gave up. It&#8217;s just repetition of the same things all the time. And there are other chapters, I know. I skimmed them quickly. Time and time again, it&#8217;s filled with repetition. And sad stories about Sandberg and her dead husband.

This is the first book I have not finished in years. Wow. I feel kind of bad because of it. But it&#8217;s just like Barbara says on the Goodreads post about quitting a book. This is not the book for me. I&#8217;m sorry, but that&#8217;s how it is. If this book helps you, great! For me, it&#8217;s worth only 1 star.
