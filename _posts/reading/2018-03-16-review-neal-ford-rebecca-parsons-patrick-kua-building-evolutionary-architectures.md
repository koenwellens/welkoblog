title: 'Review: Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons & Patrick Kua - Building Evolutionary Architectures'
description: 'As much as I love fiction, I also like to master new skills for my profession. This means I also read a lot software-related non-fiction books. <em>Building Evolutionary Architectures</em> is one I thought I should read. Because it&#8217;s about architectures, evolutionary ones even so. It&#8217;s been too long since I&#8217;ve read a good book about the topic. Here&#8217;s what I thought of the book.'

<em>Building Evolutionary Architectures</em> is criticised because of its overuse of biological terms. I get that. They do it a lot. However, if you understand what they&#8217;re going for, it doesn&#8217;t botter you that much. What did bother me was the fact that at some points the book was selling stuff. Either other books from the authors or even products from the company they work. That was a bummer.

There was also a lot of repetition in this book. In the end, there wasn&#8217;t that much in it that was new to me. I do like the idea of fitness functions and making them upfront. A lot of things that are explained are logic, but the diagrams provided help understand the impact. Like, what is a plugin architecture? Okay, it&#8217;s logic. There&#8217;s plugins. But when you see it, you completely understand how it works.

I wasn&#8217;t too happy with this book. In the end, I had expected something different. I don&#8217;t know what, actually. But there was too much &#8220;old-news&#8221; in this book. Therefore I rate it 3 stars. Also, here&#8217;s a nice line from the book.
