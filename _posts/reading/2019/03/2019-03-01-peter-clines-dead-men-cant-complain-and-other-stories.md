I like the stories Peter Clines writes. That's why I've read all the Ex-Heroes books, Threshold stories and why I've got his newest book - <em>Dead Moon</em> - very high on my priority list.

Most of these stories are funny. Predictable, but funny. I really like the opener. It got me in a flow, so that I wanted to keep reading all the stories in this collection.

For an ex-heroes fan, this book is great. There's even an ex-related short story in there. But sadly enough, most of the stories are quite the same. In the end, the plot of most stories resemble each other much more than I would have liked. Too bad!

Of course I cannot criticize things like character development. Some stories were only a few pages long! But Clines is a master at this, and gets you to like his characters in no time. I believe he's a great writer and I still hope he publishes Ex-Tension sometime soon. Please do so, Peter!

This book is great for: people who don't really know Peter Clines; people who know Peter Clines and haven't read this book yet; people who want to read fun fantasy stories without getting too involved.

All in all, I liked this book. But then again, I'm a Peter Clines fan. Therefore, my rating of ✩✩✩✩ might be a bit biased. 

How did you like <em>Dead Men Can't Complain and Other Stories</em>? Or haven't you read it yet? Go to the store and buy it now! Let me know what you think about it!
