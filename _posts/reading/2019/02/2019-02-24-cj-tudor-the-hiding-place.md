At the beginning of the novel, I was getting a bit annoyed. The author writes to get a maximum amount of suspense, and that was getting on my nerve. Mostly because in the beginning, you don't really know what is going on. You just know that Joe is back in town because of some things that happened. When details about the backstory became clear, the story got a lot better.

I very much like how Joe changes throughout the book. From the man he is, to the man he wants to be, to whom he really is. The part about Brandon is a bit easy and short, but I liked the other parts so I'm not going to argue much about that.

C.J. Tudor stated on her Goodreads page that she's a fan of Stephen King and you really feel that in this book. There are two types of horror stories: those that are psychological and those that are gory. If this is a horror story, and in some way it is, it would be in the first category. I like.

I enjoyed <em>The Chalk Man</em> but I liked <em>The Hiding Place</em> even more. Especially keeping in mind that this is only the second book of the author. Definitely a ✩✩✩✩ book! One thing is clear, I'm going to keep following the author. I think more good books will come my way if I do.
