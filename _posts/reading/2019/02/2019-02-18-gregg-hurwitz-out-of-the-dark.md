description: "I've been waiting a year to read the follow-up story to <em>Hell Bent</em>. When it got out, I immediately bought it! Fun fact, while listening to the audiobook and hearing hackers hacking devices, my media device stopped working. That's how thin the line  between fiction and reality is when Hurwitz is writing."

Evan Smoak is back for his greatest mission so far. Can he do the impossible and kill the man responsible for everything that happened in the previous books? And what's special about his first mission in 1997? We find out in this book, but Orphan X needs to make sure he doesn't get killed in the process. This time, it's Orphan A who's hunting him.

<em>Out of the Dark</em> is another great addition to the already amazing Orphan X universe. Not only is it fast-paced, full of the right details and finished with a nice touch of humour, it's also a story about humanity, standing up for others and being yourself. Because in the end, that's all we can be.

I always fear that long running series will have their characters dry out. What keeps long-written characters worth following? Good writers, like Hurwitz. They know how to keep the persona's fresh and have their protagonists evolve to an even higher level. That's the story of Evan Smoak.

I'm not going to lie to you. At the end of the story, I felt a bit let down. But before I get to that, I want to stress out all the amazing things that make this a ✩✩✩✩✩ book. There aren't many books that get me, but this one did. Because I wanted to know what Evan had planned for his mission. Because of his alter ego that keeps an eye out for the little man. And because of Evan Smoak himself, as nothing is normal with this special person.

But there were some shortcomings in my opinion. I thought Orphan A would be the next Orphan Y. While it might be good that this wasn't the case, I was a bit let down that we only get to enjoy this character for the short time we have. But even worse, I'm feeling a bit scared for the next books. All the previous books ended in a way that let you know even more was coming. But what can come now? Hurwitz tweeted that there will be more Orphan X books in the future, but it feels hard to top what is already here.

One thing is for sure. I will buy the next one and chances are very high I will enjoy it just as much as this one. Thanks for this great book, Gregg!
