description: "This year, I'm reading a bit more slowly. Or at least, so it seems. I'm also reading books that I think will be good and are new. Instead of going for goals, I'm more going for reading what I like now. Sounds like someone who can't reach his goals would say, right?"

One of these books that was recently released, is <em>An Anonymous Girl</em>. It's written by two authors and you can see that, but not too much. The problem with two authors is that the two writing styles need to align throughout the book. I think these ladies did a wonderful thing in that regard.

There's a lot of suspense in this book, which is good for a psychological suspense novel I guess. The way it's written, it always leaves you wanting to read more. There's some action but most of the story is really about thinking and making tough decisions.

I started out as liking the main character, then got to dislike her because she seemed overly naive. Then I liked her again because she finally stood up for herself. That was long overdue.

Near the beginning of the third part, I was thinking: wow, there's no character development at all in this book. There's just a cat and its prey. But the authors proved me wrong. Jessica goes through a large transformation that also makes you feel with her. 

This book was very enjoyable. If you want a fun book that's quite mature and keeps you turning pages, read this. It's definitely a ✩✩✩✩ book!
