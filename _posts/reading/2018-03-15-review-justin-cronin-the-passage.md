title: 'Review: Justin Cronin - The Passage'
description: 'Sorry for me not blogging a lot recently. Things have happened. Anyway, I&#8217;ve managed to finally finish another book. It has been a while. It&#8217;s been a long book as well. Who knew. I came by Justin Cronin&#8217;s <em>The Passage</em> series after a tweet from Stephen King. He recommended the third instalment. That was interesting. Thought I&#8217;d not skip books one and two, and picked up _The Passage_. Here&#8217;s my review.'

<em>The Passage</em> is apocalyptic &#8211; at its best. There is so much chaos. There are multiple point of views. And it&#8217;s all done really, <em>really</em> well. Cronin proves to master the art of different, deep points of view. An example: the beginning of the story notices many details from the first point of view. Not all details matter. But they make it real.

Something <em>bad</em> happens. And then the world as we know it falls apart. The first part, the build-up, is awesome. Then there&#8217;s a strange, maybe rushed part and then there&#8217;s the real story. I struggled with the rushed part. But I loved the ending. This book was well worth the read!

Whenever in the future I&#8217;ll be asked what kind of books I like, I&#8217;m sure this one is going to be on my mind. I can&#8217;t wait to read the next instalment(s) of the series. There are so many things that can happen. This story is great! Worth 4 stars. Read it!
