description: 'I have finished it. This might sound weird, given I finish a lot of books. But this one was special. First, it&#8217;s work related. In the way that it is about where I want my career to go. Second, I&#8217;ve been reading it for almost a year. I started it, then let it lie. Why? Because&#8230; Reasons.'

Here&#8217;s my review of this great book by two great agile coaches.

Let me just start with saying I regret not finishing this sooner. I wish this post was about a re-read rather than a first read. Because there is so much good advice in this book. It&#8217;s a collection of useful information for anyone interested in agile coaching.

There are many things in this book that are not new for me. Yet it is good to see them written down. What I thought was great is how the authors added personal stories to help point out certain practices. A lesser thing were the grey boxes. They were at almost every page and sometimes split the story. I started to feel bad about those.

Everyone who is interested in agile coaching should READ. THIS. BOOK. If you don&#8217;t, I think you&#8217;re not taking it seriously. I wish I had finished it sooner. Don&#8217;t make the same mistake as me. Pick up this  star book now and finish it, you agile coach you!
