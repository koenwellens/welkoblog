title: 'Review: The Arbinger Institute - The Outward Mindset'
description: 'In the previous months, I&#8217;ve read some Arbinger Institute books. First, there was <em>Leadership and Self-Deception</em>: a true eye-opener. It sparked my interest for the other books they made. And so I read <em>The Anatomy of Peace</em>. That book still taught me something new, but I felt kind of disappointed afterwards. It seemed <em>Leadership and Self-Deception</em> had something extra.'

In comes <em>The Outward Mindset</em>. This book dives deeper into the material the Arbinger Institute wants to share with others. Here&#8217;s my opinion on it.

In comparison to the other books, <em>The Outward Mindset</em> does not follow one character in a workshop about the topic. Instead, the Arbinger Institute has bundled together examples they came across themselves. Whether it was the institute itself that had an inward minset or companies where they went to consult, that does not matter. No examples, from any context, are spared.

Just like <em>Leadership and Self-Deception</em>, this book is a real eye-opener. It explains what the outward mindset is, how to recognise an inward mindset and how to change mindsets. Simply put, this book has it all! It&#8217;s written decently, with a light touch of humour here and there.

What really strikes me when reading these kind of books, is that I really want to do something with this. The Arbinger Institute wants to help people so they too can help people. But, as explained in the book, that does not mean that people become soft. Which is, in my opinion, exactly what one needs when leading.

I want to go preach about this book. That&#8217;s how much I like it. If you haven&#8217;t read this one yet, please go and do so. It can be read, like I did, after _Leadership and Self-Deception _and/or after <em>The Anatomy of Peace</em> or as a single book. It&#8217;s worth more than 5 stars (but my Goodreads-bar says 5 stars is the maximum).
