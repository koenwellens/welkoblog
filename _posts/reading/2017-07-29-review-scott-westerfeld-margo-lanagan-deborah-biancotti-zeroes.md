title: 'Review: Scott Westerfeld, Margo Lanagan & Deborah Biancotti - Zeroes'
description: 'Briefly before I left for our road trip, I was able to finish a book about teenagers with superpowers. <em>Zeroes</em> is a book written by three authors, and I found it on a Goodreads list full of superhero books. As you (may or may not) know, I am a big fan of super-humans and super-villains. I therefore had some expectations when I started reading this book.'

The story introduces teenagers that seem to have superhuman abilities. Most of them can do things with crowds of people. Others seem to have more 1-to-1 capabilities. So the build-up for this book was great. I expected even more as the story began. It didn&#8217;t fill in those expectations though.

The book throws you in a story where the main characters seem to get themselves in a lot of trouble. They are actually their own worst enemies. They have superpowers but they don&#8217;t really learn to use them better, even though that&#8217;s exactly what one of the zeroes is hoping for.

When I was halfway through the book, I started doubting whether I should finish it. But then I thought this story might be a background story of some kind, since it&#8217;s the first of a trilogy. But there was no background. There was barely character build-up. It was sad, actually.

I ended up finishing the book mostly because I did not have the time to read something else before our road trip. In the end, I was really _really_ disappointed. What I like most about superheroes, are their supervillains. In this book there were none. There was hardly any character build-up. I have given it some thought, and decided to give this book 2 stars. That should be plenty.
