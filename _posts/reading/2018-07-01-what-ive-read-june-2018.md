Maybe it&#8217;s because of the books&#8230; let&#8217;s go over those!

## The Whispering Room

I revisited the Jane Hawk series. I remember the first one being cool. A bit sci-fi, a lot of action and suspense. Yet not as good as an Orphan X book. I took this one up and was immediately happy that I did.

<em>The Whispering Room</em> takes us further in the crazy story Koontz is telling. At least I hope it&#8217;s crazy&#8230; and not real. Jane Hawk is a great character and making it happen. If you&#8217;re a fan of action-packed thrillers, go read this!

## We Are Legion (We Are Bob)

Not really sure how the story exact was, but I&#8217;ve been advised to read <em>We Are Legion (We Are Bob)</em> by a friend. I&#8217;ve postponed it for a long time. Too long, come to think of it now.

This very funny, futuristic science-fiction story is a great read. Anyone can enjoy it. It&#8217;s not technical and there are so many pop-culture references. You&#8217;ll love it!

## Writing Deep Point of View

As a WW &#8211; <em>Writer Wannabe &#8211; </em>I try to learn a lot about the craft. Rayne Hall helps me a lot with that. She&#8217;s written many books for different genres and different writing styles. One style is deep point of view. Because I want to master it, I read her tips about it.

Any starting author should read Rayne Hall&#8217;s books. They&#8217;re great. they provide examples and tips. They&#8217;re not textbooks &#8211; filled with theory after theory &#8211; and they&#8217;re the perfect size. Really, I recommend this to any writer that wants to improve.

## The Rules of Supervillainy

Ah, we come to my seasonal theme book. <em>The Rules of Supervillainy</em> is a book that throws you into the genre immediately. C.T. Phipps provides a Deadpool-esque view on supervillainy through the eyes of Merciless, the supervillain without mercy. If you&#8217;re a superhero/villain fan, read this. Laughs assured!

## Building Microservices

In software development, microservices are the new black. It&#8217;s crazy. At a conference the question isn&#8217;t who has worked on them before, the question is who isn&#8217;t working on them yet. Sam Newman tries to explain the basics behind the microservices, as well as provide tips and libraries that you can use when building them.

Any software engineer that builds scalable, modern software should read this book. It provides great insights in the creation of the topic that&#8217;s so hot for the last five years.

## Barking Up the Wrong Tree

Eric Barker is a funny guy who shares his knowledge about success. What do you need to do to be successful in life? With quotes of Dan Ariely and Daniel Pink, you know this book fits in their categories perfectly. It is a fun read for anyone, even you!

Small spoiler alert: at the end of the book, Barker mentions his contact details and asks you to write him if you liked the book. So I did. And he replied. One of the things I asked was why his website is called &#8216;bakadesuyo&#8217;. The answer is funny.

## For We Are Many

I had already surpassed my five books I wanted to read in June, so I had to go for another one. I decided to continue the Bobiverse as it was very funny. The second book, <em>For We Are Many</em>, provides us even more of that. Funny jokes, cool references, likeable characters and a great storyline. Dennis E. Taylor sure did a great job with these books.

## The Games of Supervillainy

Merciless, the supervillain without Mercy, returns in the second book of the supervillainy saga. I liked this one even more than its predecessor. C.T. Phipps is scoring great points here. Although I must say, there was an <em>Ex-Heroes</em> vibe in this one. I guess that&#8217;s what superpowered people fighting against zombies will do for you.

<em>The Games of Supervillainy</em> takes you on a road where you don&#8217;t really get to know a lot of side-character build-up. But it makes you feel for a crazy, moronic supervillain with brilliant, evil and insane ideas. That on its own is an art. Pick up this series if you like superheroes!

## All These Worlds

With still time to spare, I finished the Bobiverse books. And I was sad. The trilogy ended nicely, the characters were fun, the jokes were great. There really wasn&#8217;t anything bad about this book. I guess I&#8217;m sad that this was only a trilogy. What happened to Bender? Will Medeiros attack again? Those and other questions I&#8217;d really like to see answered.

But do you want to know some good news? Read it yourself:

## Write Every Day

Lastly, I read a shorter e-book about improving your writing process. This piece of gold is well written and can help anyone. Whether you&#8217;re a writer, a baker or even a police officer. The tips in this book are what we call <em>agile</em> in the software industry. Read it. Thank me later.

## What&#8217;s Next? July 2018

I&#8217;m a bit unsure of what to set as my next goal. I set five for June, but I was able to do ten. So, how much for July? I&#8217;m thinking about <b>seven</b>. It&#8217;s the average of what I&#8217;ve read in those two months. But what will I read?

Currently, I&#8217;ve already started <em>The Crooked Staircase</em>. Just like <em>The Secrets of Supervillainy</em>, it&#8217;s part of a series. The latter and <em>So Not a Hero</em> are two superhero books, so they fit the seasonal theme. <em>Station Eleven</em> and <em>The Plot Whisperer</em> are just two of the books that are standalone. <em>How to Win Friends & Influence People</em> as well as the aforementioned writing help book is non-fiction.

There. Seven books. Let&#8217;s try to accomplish that in July! What is your reading goal? And did you reach your reading goal of June? Let me know by leaving a comment!
