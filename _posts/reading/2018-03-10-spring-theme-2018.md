I&#8217;m not having a terrific week. I didn&#8217;t have much to blog about either. Well, here&#8217;s something that was bound to happen: I&#8217;m changing my theme! The theme for winter was books with a blue cover. With spring on the way, it&#8217;s time for a new theme. And I want to inform you that I&#8217;ve chosen for&#8230;

&#8220;Yes!&#8221;,  the space-savvy science-fiction fan inside of me shouts out. There are some space books I&#8217;ve postponed in reading over the last years. Time to go for this theme instead of the blue covers books!

You can expect some more space books in the next months! Until June, when I reveal my summer theme&#8230;
