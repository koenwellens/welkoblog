title: 'Review: Randall Munroe - what if? Serious Scientific Questions to Absurd Hypothetical Questions'
description: 'I have been a fan of xkcd for quite some time. A lot of Randall Munroe&#8217;s comics concern IT and technology jokes, and I&#8217;m always in for that! On his website, he also has a &#8220;what if&#8221; inbox. Here, he allows people to ask absurd hypothetical questions which he will answer as seriously as possible. And then he went and made a book of those questions and answers!'

I enjoyed <em>What If</em>. Because, as you might know by now, I like tech humour. Also, it&#8217;s just well written and has this sort of vibe to it. It reads easy even though there&#8217;s a lot of technicalities explaining certain physical and chemical aspects.

Randall Munroe thought me a lot of things with this book, like why there&#8217;s fire in front of a space shuttle when it comes back into orbit. While deepening into some of the aforementioned technicalities, Munroe succeeds at adding funny jokes and keeping your attention. He proves to be a great writer. He does a good job at coming back on certain elements he already discussed before. That way, he can link his questions together.

## Conclusion

Even though this book has no real story, you still want to read all of it. But since there&#8217;s no real story in it, I cannot give it as high a rating as other books I&#8217;ve read. But hey, four stars ain&#8217;t bad, right?
