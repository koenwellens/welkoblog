I have enjoyed this book amazingly. I really didn&#8217;t expect I would. In the beginning I was sceptical. Damn, this story was predictable. But then it deepened. And darkened. And was so good. And because of the predictability of one part of the plot, I had completely forgotten several details. They gave the story surprising twists.

<em>The Woman in the Window</em> truly is a great book. The last scene wasn&#8217;t the best part of the book. But the entire plot is brilliant. My hat off to you, mr. Finn. I am looking forward to read more from you.

I give this bookÂ 4 stars. Although I&#8217;m still very excited about it at the moment, there were parts of the book where I doubted the story. Mostly in the beginning and the last scene, it seemed to let me down. Nevertheless, if you are a fan of this genre (psychological thrillers) you must read this book. It&#8217;s awesome!

Have you already read it? Tell me what&#8217;s on your mind!
