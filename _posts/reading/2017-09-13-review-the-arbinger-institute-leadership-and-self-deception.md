title: 'Review: The Arbinger Institute - Leadership and Self-Deception'
description: 'In May, I added <em>Leadership and Self-Deception</em> to my list of books to read. I don&#8217;t remember how. Did I get a suggestion by a friend? Was it suggested by Goodreads? Or have I found it on a list of similar books? I really don&#8217;t remember. What I do remember is that I wanted to read it. The last three days, I did. And here&#8217;s what I think of it.'

The Arbinger Institute has put together a story that shows the daily mistakes people make. They could have gone for a textbook approach, with fancy diagrams and highlighted definitions. Instead they chose for a _story_. We follow Tom as he learns what self-deception is. How we betray ourselves and get inside **the box**.

I have read other books where the content is explained as a story and they were always kind of predictable. <em>Leadership and Self-Deception</em> is not. What could have been better? I&#8217;m kind of stuck on how the authors say it is difficult to explain the concepts in this book. And so I might have hoped for some help in this. But I think I get that too: just keep trying and being out of the box as much as possible.

I was amazed when I read this book. I rate it 5 stars. It&#8217;s an eye-opener. I also really feel like I want to do something with this, other than staying out of the box myself.

Have you read <em>Leadership and Self-Deception: Getting out of the Box</em>? What did you think of it? Let me know in the section below!
