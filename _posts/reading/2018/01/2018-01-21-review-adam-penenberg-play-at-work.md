I have always been a fan of gamification. Games have been a large part of my life. I like all sorts of games, as long as they&#8217;re fun. So what better work is there where you can also play games? With that in mind, I started reading this book. Here are my thoughts on it.

What I expected from this book was to get some tips in doing gamification at my own job. However, that&#8217;s not what I got out of it. The book covers lots of stories about gamification and studies behind it. What works and what doesn&#8217;t? They explain this by providing success stories. Most of these stories are overly detailed. That makes some parts of this book a real struggle to get through.

While the outcome was not exactly what I had hoped for, I did get an idea about gamification. If it works out, you&#8217;ll be the first to read it! A good thing about the book is that it&#8217;s fun. There&#8217;s some jokes in there and it&#8217;s about games. So naturally, it&#8217;s fun! However, I expected more from it and most of the time it was too detailed. And then there was this ending note on the sim argument&#8230; That&#8217;s far fetched. But in a fictional world that could make sense, I guess!

I rate this book  stars. If you&#8217;re looking for examples on how certain companies interpreted gamification, this book can provide you stories and cases. However, don&#8217;t read this book expecting to learn a lot of gamification design. It doesn&#8217;t really help you learn that.
