In this series of <em>Reading 101</em>, I&#8217;m hoping to give you tips and tricks to help you improve your reading. We&#8217;ve first discussed some excuses people use for not reading books. Then we had a look at different genres. There is a book for everyone! Before this post, there was a summary on the types of books available. Now let&#8217;s have a look at where you can read.

## Petty Chores

Everyone has petty chores. Whether it&#8217;s ironing, cleaning or mowing the lawn, we all have things to do at home. When I mow the lawn or help my wife cleaning, I listen to an audiobook. This truly is a <em>lot</em> of reading time. Even during cooking or washing dishes, you can listen to an audiobook. Let me share some things I&#8217;ve learnt from it.

Make sure you can concentrate on what you&#8217;re doing. Don&#8217;t pick a book that requires 100% of your concentration while you&#8217;re making a meal for the first time, following a recipe. Instead, pick something fun. A book that requires all of your focus is good for when you mow the lawn. Because mowing the lawn is simple and repetitive.

Also, if you&#8217;re helping your partner of someone else during the chore, it&#8217;s also advisable to not listen to a book. Because that person will want to communicate with you. Don&#8217;t be an asshole who ignores the other one. Collaborate!

## On the Road

I spend a lot of time on the road. When you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ll also find this time wasted. What can you do? You&#8217;re driving your car for over one hour per day. It&#8217;s not like you could <em>LISTEN</em> to a book&#8230; right? Oh wait! Yes you can!

Then, for your job, you have to travel differently. Suddenly, you&#8217;re on the train for about an hour to get to your customer. Here, any format is possible! You can read paper books, e-books and listen to audiobooks. I myself prefer e-books over paper books on the train. I don&#8217;t know why, but for some reason I find it consumes less of my energy. Although I sometimes listen to an audiobook as well.

Even by bike or on foot, I try to listen to audiobooks as much as possible. Use as much of my time reading. You&#8217;ll find you can do it too!

## Go Mobile

When I&#8217;m at a supermarket, I listen to an audiobook. Waiting to get my hair cut? Audiobook. Standing in line, anywhere? Audiobook. Waiting to get my food brought to me when I&#8217;m alone at a restaurant? Yep, I&#8217;m reading.

Once you commit to reading, you&#8217;ll find many places where it&#8217;s possible. These days, <em>the digital era</em>, books exist in all formats imaginable. Try it out. Look for moments in your life when you think you&#8217;re wasting time. Where are you at that place? Is it possible to use that time to read a book? Spoiler alert: the answer is probably yes.

There you have it. A blog post about all the places where I read. And what kind of books I read. Of course, I also read normal books late at night in my bed or when lying on the sofa. But that&#8217;s the smaller part of my reading time. Like I said, I try to read anywhere!

Now, what can you do with this? Let&#8217;s talk about that in my next blog post. I will introduce the 8-minute reading habit, based on the 8-Minute Writing Habit by Monica Leonelle. Let&#8217;s see how that goes.

Where do you read? I&#8217;m interested in finding out! Let me know by leaving a comment or sending me a tweet!
