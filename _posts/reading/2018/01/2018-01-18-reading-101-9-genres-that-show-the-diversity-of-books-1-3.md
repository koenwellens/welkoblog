When I read a book that I absolutely love, there’s just one thing I want to do: talk about it with others. Then I notice how many people don’t read books. In this series of blogposts, _Reading 101_, I aim at helping you get a reading habit. Now that we&#8217;ve cleared your head from doubts, we can look at all the different flavours of the book dish. There are a lot of genres, but today I&#8217;d like to discuss three: crime, comedy and historical.

## Crime

Books that involve the police following a murder, investigating a theft or rolling up a gang are mostly about _crime_. In these books, the focus is on sleuthing. These detective tales can be either straightforward or mysterious. You can find them combined with action and suspense too.

This is a genre I like. Detective stories take you on a quest. Something has happened&#8230; and you need to help solve it! If it&#8217;s a good book &#8211; <em>which most of them are</em> &#8211; the story will take many twists and turns. These kinds of plots can leave you emotional, shaking from fear or plain happy that the criminals got caught.

Goodreads, my favourite website on book information, has a section on crime books. It also shows some books you might like. One of my favourite authors, Gregg Hurwitz, has a series of crime books called the _Tim Rackley Series_. Even Stephen King, of whom I&#8217;ve been a fan since forever, has tried the crime genre. Check out his Bill Hodges series!

## Comedy

If you like a good laugh, this genre is something for you! Comedy is littered with jokes and puns purely intended to make you feel good. Books from this genre come in different kinds and sizes. Although these stories exist to amuse the reader, this goal might not always be as obvious as it first seems.

I love dry humour. Silly jokes make me laugh and holler. I can really enjoy a book with good puns and even better farces. You can find a section on comedy books on Goodreads too.

Last year, I found out Scott Meyer wrote books. I read his Magic 2.0 series. It&#8217;s filled with silly jokes and stereotypical puns. But comedy books don&#8217;t need to be fiction! <em>What If</em> is a non-fiction books written with one intention: to make you laugh. Or can I interest you in a science fiction drama? Andy Weir, author of <em>The Martian</em>, puts a lot of effort in adding humour in his books!

## Historical

Do you like museums? Are you interested in Middle Age fiction? Do I have the genre for you! Historical books take place in the past. You&#8217;re not going to find a historical book that is set in the future. This has some advantages. For one, you know what happened during an event, but the author share take a different perspective on it. Most likely, you&#8217;re going to find some historical characters too. If that&#8217;s what you want, pick up a historical book.

I am not the biggest fan of historical books. I never really liked History classes, so that might have something to do with it. Most of the time I get stuck in the details used to describe the era and place. But if this is what you are interested in, there&#8217;s a list on Goodreads that I can forward you to. Have a look!

This blog post has me discussing three genres of books. Crime, Comedy and Historical books have different target audiences and tend to be completely different. While I&#8217;m a fan of Crime and Comedy books, I myself do not read much Historical stories. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t!

We will discuss three more genres in my next blog post. You&#8217;ll find me talking about my all time favourite: Horror. We will touch the surface of Non-Fiction and we&#8217;ll even have a look at Romantic books.

Do you have a question about these genres? Or are you interested in knowing more? Just give a comment and I&#8217;ll get back to you!
