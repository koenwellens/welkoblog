title: 'Review: Rayne Hall - Writing Fight Scenes'
description: 'I have a dream of becoming a professional writer. There. I said it. I&#8217;ve always been quite shy about it. Never having enough confidence to really start doing it. So I figured I&#8217;d start by reading books. Find out what works and what doesn&#8217;t. That kind of stuff. Now I have found some books to really help writers. <em>Writing Fight Scenes</em> is one of them.'

I didn&#8217;t really intend to write a fight scene as the first thing I would create. But this is Hall&#8217;s first book and I thought it&#8217;d be best to start at the beginning. Are you ready?

Rayne Hall wrote this book to help you at some of the more difficult scenes in your book. How is the protagonist supposed to feel? What is he supposed to see? What is he using to fight? How much detail do you need? Hall mentions all these topics. Even gender-specific details are included, like how women fighting  in self-defence is more likeable by a reader.

Everything I had hoped to get out of this book, was there. There are links to youtube for scenes that illustrate what the author is talking about. There are tips, tricks and lists of do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts for almost every topic described. I feel quite confident I could write an interesting fight scene, which I will try out in a future blogpost. That does not mean that I won&#8217;t go back to this book for help. It&#8217;s really useful!

The book itself is to the point and provides you exactly what it promises. Are you having trouble writing fight scenes or are you interested in what differentiates your fight scenes from those epic ones you always read about? Then this book is exactly what you are looking for! I rate it  stars.
