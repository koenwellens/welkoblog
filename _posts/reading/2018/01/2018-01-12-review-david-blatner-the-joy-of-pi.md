title: 'Review: David Blatner - The Joy of Pi'
description: 'There are five books that I wanted to read this month, but this week I ran into a problem. I was away from my books and wanted to read, but had nothing on me. So I decided to listen to a short audiobook. <em>The Joy of Pi</em> is a book I had planned to read for a long time, but I just never got to it. This has now changed. Here&#8217;s my opinion on the audiobook about Pi.'

This was a funny book. Granted, there are a lot of historical stuff you need to get through. The good thing is that they&#8217;re not so much and it&#8217;s written in a way that makes it easier to get through the historical blubber. There are small facts about Pi that I didn&#8217;t know yet. Now I can ramble on against everybody about the strange link between Pi and the number 360.

I have a mathematical background so I surely liked the content of this book. But there&#8217;s a lot of mystery in Pi, like Blatner says. What I like about this book is how he tries to give you an objective view on the history of humanity in regard to Pi. And some fun things like techniques to help you remember the digits.

I really enjoyed this book, but that might be because I have always liked maths. Maybe others don&#8217;t like it as much, but that&#8217;s their thing. Even if you don&#8217;t know a lot about all the maths behind it, this book still gives some fun facts and tricks about the number Pi. I rate it 4 stars, mostly because of the sound effects used in the audiobook. Those were quite annoying.

Have you read <em>The Joy of Pi</em>? What is your opinion on it? Have you listened to the audiobook? I&#8217;m eager to hear from you!
