title: 'Review: Marcus Sakey - Brilliance'
description: 'Ten books already in January! That&#8217;s the pace I&#8217;m setting. I&#8217;m amazing myself. So when I was looking for a book, I was directed to Marcus Sakey via Twitter. When I looked him up on Goodreads I found&#8230; some shelved books already! Apparently I already ran across Sakey in the past and put him on my to-read list. With <em>Brilliance</em>, I started his trilogy about &#8220;brilliants&#8221;. Here&#8217;s my review.'

<em>Brilliance</em> follows the life of Nick Cooper, a federal agent. A special agent. A brilliant. He fights terrorist brilliants. People just like him, only they hurt innocent people. While Cooper is a great character, he sometimes proves to be a dumb hypocrite. The other characters make up for it though. Like Shannon. She&#8217;s great!

The plot in this book is awesome. It reads like a high-speed train! How come I didn&#8217;t read this book earlier? I don&#8217;t understand&#8230; Although the plot is not something that would normally grip me like this, I think it&#8217;s mostly the characters that do it. Sakey did a great job on them.

For me, this is a 4 star book. It&#8217;s certainly great and I know who else would like it. But I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it to everyone. Now that I read this book and found out it&#8217;s the first in a trilogy, you can expect more reviews of the Brilliance Saga soon!
