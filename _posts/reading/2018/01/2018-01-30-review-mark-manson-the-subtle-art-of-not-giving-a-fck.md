This short book spiked my interest immediately. While Manson has some blunt remarks, he mostly adds humour to exaggerate and make his points more clear. His points being the following: stop giving so many fucks. Which is not the same as: don&#8217;t give any fucks. That is something completely different.

Manson uses good stories to prove his point and makes it. He follows the words he preaches. It&#8217;s very clear that about some points, he just doesn&#8217;t give a fuck. And that&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s also okay if you don&#8217;t. Or if you do. It doesn&#8217;t really matter. That&#8217;s all there is, you know.

I rate this book 4 stars. It&#8217;s not perfect, and Manson is really blunt in the beginning of his book. Then after chapter 3, he gets a bit repetitive. Passed that, this is a really good book. Well written. Well thought through. I gave a fuck!

Is this a book you give a fuck about? Leave your fucks in the comment section below!
