description: 'I&#8217;ve been looking for a <b>train</b> book. What I mean with that? I&#8217;ve been travelling with the train a lot lately. So I wanted to read something when I was on the train. And I wanted to read a book about coaching. Coaching and training. Haha, see what I did there?'

I found <em>Coaching for Performance: GROWing Human Potential and Purpose</em> in the library at my work. From there I took the book and started reading it. Here are my thoughts about it!

<em>Coaching for Performance</em> is a widely known book about the subject. Many coaches have read it and even at my job a lot of people who have no coaching role have had their fingers on this book. So, I figured, why is that? Or as John Whitmore would ask: what are the reasons for that?

The book describes a simple technique to help you coach other people. The GROW technique &#8211; **Goals, Reality, Options, Will** &#8211; is an easy, four-step plan that helps coaches. For instance: my goal is to read 60 books this year. The reality is that I&#8217;ve already managed to read 51 books last year. So what options do I have? Shorter books, reading more, reading better choices of books (by which I mean I would no longer read books that I don&#8217;t like). So what will I do? I&#8217;ve already explained that I will vary the books more often. And I expect to have more time to read this year. So that should do the trick!

I found this book very useful! Not every chapter was as useful as the ones about the GROW technique, but still worth the read. I even took pictures from this book. I&#8217;ve never done that before!

For me this book is worth 4 stars. Not really a book that I want to talk about with everyone, but I am glad that I read it. And if you&#8217;re into coaching, you really got to read this book!

Have you read <em>Coaching for Performance</em>? What are your thoughts on it? Or are you interested in reading it? Just let me know. The comments section awaits you!
