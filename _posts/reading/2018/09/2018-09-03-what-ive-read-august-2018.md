### Missed Opportunities

When I last wrote a Monthly Summary, I was hoping to read <em>No Turning Back</em> by Marcus Sakey. I didn't get to that book in time, although I'm already at page 150 as of writing this blog post. Instead, I went for <em>Station Eleven</em>. Sadly enough.

### The Outsider
This long book is the last one Stephen King has written to date. And boy, does he know his skills. From the first paragraph to the last word, he can keep you turning pages until your fingers go numb. It's such a relief to see that the old master is still at the top of his league.

It's actually part of the Finders Keepers series, which used to be the Bill Hodges trilogy. But you don't need to read the previous books to be able to follow this story. Yet it helps. If you haven't gone for <em>The Outsider</em> yet, go now. It's awesome!

### Accelerate

I've seen a lot of people in the software industry talk praise about the latest Gene Kim book. So I figured, what's all this fuzz about? Turns out the book really makes good points and strong statements, covering it with the required statistics that back it all up.

If you're interested in how software teams should work, this is a book you must read. The last part describes the mindset a company should have, although I think the case written down is another of those Spotify model stories. Don't just copy, evolve!

### The Science of Supervillainy

Ah, I was looking forward to reading more about Merciless, the supervillain without mercy! While the previous book in the saga left me a bit unsatisfied, this one made up for it big time! <em>The Sciende of Supervillainy</em> provides a lot of laughter, sarcasm, character development and a great story as well! You can't think of something crazier than what is written in this book, I promise!

It was worth reading through this series. I can't wait to read the next part. If you haven't picked up this great superhero/supervillain storyline yet, go do so now. You won't regret it!

### Station Eleven

This was the let-down of the month. I had expected to read a great dystopian novel. Instead, I got stuck with this book. The going back-and-forth in time wasn't helping the story much. There's a lot of focus on characters that in the end don't have much to do with the actual plot. Parts of the story get retold for what it seems is no purpose. And the dystopian factor feels very unreal.

Yep, this was a bummer. Not worth picking up if you ask me.

### Out of Spite, Out of Mind
Just like with <em>The Science of Supervillainy</em>, this is an instalment of a series that I had doubts about. The previous book, <em>Fight and Flight</em>, was the least in the series. Lucky for me, Scott Meyer found his second wind! All the things I thought were lacking in the last book, were present in <em>Out of Spite, Out of Mind</em>. It was funny, involved characters I'd missed and overall had a good story.

Currently, this book is only out as an audiobook. To make up for that, it's narrated by Luke Daniels. If that on its own isn't worth giving this book some time, then I don't know what is!

### The Plot Whisperer
I've been reading <em>The Plot Whisperer</em> for some time now. Not because it reads slow or because it is oversized, but because I wanted to take my time for it. There's a lot of practical help in this book for anyone who wants to write. Whether it's a short story or a novel, you can find all the help you need here.

This really is a great book. Although I was a bit sceptic in the beginning, I'm a true believer now. If you want to improve your writing, pick up this book. You won't be disappointed!

### What's Next? September 2018
I'm still not up-to-speed with my reading, so I'm not going to set my reading goal really high. But I'm currently already a few hundred pages deep in <em>No Turning Back</em> by Marcus Sakey. Here are all the books I'm planning to read in September.

Let's go over the categories! I've got a book that's part of a series and part of my summer theme: <em>Confessions of a D-List Supervillain</em>. There's two non-fiction books, <em>Make it Stick</em> and <em>The Ajax Dilemma</em>. There's also one that's not part of a series: <em>No Turning Back</em>. You see, the gang's all here!

My goal for September is <b>five</b> books. What is your goal? And what did you manage to read in August? Let me know by leaving a comment!
