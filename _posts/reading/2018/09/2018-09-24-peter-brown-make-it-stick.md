I started reading <em>Make It Stick</em> because of a mistake... I actually wanted to read a different book with almost the same name. But I wasn't too late when I realized that. I read the synopsis and decided to give this book a try anyway. I'm really happy that I did.

Although the book was a bit too long for me and had too much detail on education, I liked it a lot. It got me thinking. At all important jobs, people prepare before they perform. So why are software developers (and others) expected to perform eight hours per day without preparing? Who takes the time to really learn using their tools? Who practices problem solving on example exercises before diving in head first?

Nobody. And that's what this book made me think. Why not? And what can we do to change this? I'm thinking about that a lot the last days. I'm happy I didn't rush through this book and really let everything sink in. That helped.

Overall, this is a ✩✩✩✩ book for me. It explains exactly what I've always thought: we are not born smart or stupid. Throughout our lives, we can learn so much. I'd like to thank the authors for giving such great tips on how to do that.
