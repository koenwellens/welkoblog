title: 'Review: Dennis E. Taylor - We Are Legion (We Are Bob)'
description: 'For a year and a half, <em>We Are Legion (We Are Bob)</em> has been on my to-read list. It&#8217;s come to the point that a friend who I&#8217;ve recommended book has read this one before I have. And liked it. Which made him recommend it to me. I guess that&#8217;s how the world works. As a last space-themed book, I thought this one was quite appropriate. Here&#8217;s my review.'

In this book, we follow Bob Johansson for what is most likely the most unlikely story possible. Getting revived in the future, only to become an artificial intelligence? It&#8217;s a fun concept, but I liked how creative Taylor is. He has a sarcastic way of writing, providing plenty pop-culture references, that really floats my boat.

I don&#8217;t want to spoil, but the title already suggests it. And if you don&#8217;t get it, read the bible. At some point, there will be many Bobs. It is very funny, very weird and sometimes a little bit confusing. We view the story through many points of view, while still viewing it as Bob. Well done, I&#8217;d say. Although at some point it gets hard to keep track of the Bobs.

I enjoyed this book a lot. I&#8217;ve been laughing a lot, trying to convince other people to read it. The only problem I had was when I couldn&#8217;t keep track of the Bobs. The story is definitely not over, as there are many loose ends.Which means there will be more books like this. Hurray! My rating is ✩✩✩✩, by the way.
