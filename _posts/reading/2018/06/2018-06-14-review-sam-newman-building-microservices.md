title: 'Review: Sam Newman - Building Microservices'
description: 'Sometimes, I read books that are related to my job. <em>Building Microservices</em> is one of them. For those who don&#8217;t know, Microservices are the buzzword in software development for the past 8 years. You can&#8217;t go to a conference without people asking you whether you build microservices. Yet so many people do it wrong. That&#8217;s where this book comes in. Or so I hoped. Let&#8217;s find out what I learnt from it.'

Newman starts his book by giving his view on software development and why he doesn&#8217;t like the term software architects. This already shows that the man has got it right. He then explains microservices, the ideas behind them and how to build them in a correct way.

There are so many useful references in this book. While there aren&#8217;t that much code examples, which is okay given the topics Newman touches, you get a good idea of what needs to be done. At the end, the book seems to read less smooth than in the beginning.

<em>Building Microservices</em> is a useful book for anyone in software development. It&#8217;s technical, but only up to a certain level. I am happy that I read it, although the last chapters slowed me down. I rate this book ✩✩✩✩ stars.
