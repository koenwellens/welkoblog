title: 'Review: Dennis E. Taylor - All These Worlds'
description: 'It&#8217;s been a long time since I stumbled upon a good story. One that really grips you, you know? I found it in the Bobiverse. Not in book one. Not in book two either. In the entire trilogy.  I just had to read the third book. I needed to know how the Bobiverse would transform. After the Bobs have told me their story, my time has come. Here&#8217;s my review.'

The third instalment of the series continues the storylines that were started in <em>We Are Legion (We Are Bob)</em> and <em>For We Are Many</em>. Taylor does a great job in giving the same guy different personalities. Because basically, the Bobs are one and the same guy. Or aren&#8217;t they? After reading the trilogy, you might not be so sure.

This book covers the biggest space war in human history. I mean human future. And the most beautiful story for an afterlife android. And the greatest search ever done (by Bender) in human history/future. And a cool story about the world&#8217;s funniest engineer.

I liked the first book of this trilogy. I loved the second. Now, I&#8217;m a bit sad that it&#8217;s over. I understand the whole &#8220;there are only three books in a trilogy because that&#8217;s what makes it a trilogy&#8221; thing, but still. I&#8217;d love to see more of this. Really, Dennis E. Taylor. Write an extra Bobiverse book please. I&#8217;ll rate this book ✩✩✩✩✩ stars, the rest is up to you!
