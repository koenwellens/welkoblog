I started reading the book with that one line in mind. And if you do that, it gets creepy fast. There's a moment where I just had to double check that this wasn't real and of course, it wasn't. But still, I had the feeling I shouldn't read this book late at night. Or in the dark.

What more do you want from a horror book? Good characters maybe? What this book lacks in character development it makes up in rapid horrifying events that will get your brain working over them. There's not enough time to really live with the characters, but that's not the purpose of the book. It's about the horror, not the people.

What would have frightened me to death is some more details about Jodie. Or some more events concerning him/it. But given the nature of the book, I don't think the author could have done any better. 

This book was based on stories from the Lutz family after they lived in the so-called haunted mansion. They claim that demons tormented them while they lived there and they make it sound real. Although of course all the next occupants of the house never complained of such events. But here's a theory. What if... making this public caused the demons to disappear? Public stories scare a lot less people than stories that are told from mouth to mouth. And what if that's what the demon really is after? Fear? Of course, that's just my messed up brain trying to make this real. Because it would be so cool. Creepy, but cool!

I enjoyed reading this book a lot. There's a lot of horror elements present and I like that. If the characters wouldn't have been based on real people but would have had some sort of character development, that would have made it perfect. Hence, this is a ✩✩✩✩ story for me!
