### Missed Opportunities
One of the books that I wanted to read in November was <em>Brief Cases</em>, a collection of short stories that focus on the Dresdenverse while I - like many others - am waiting for Jim Butcher to finish <em>Peace Talks</em>. Like I said, I took a small break from reading in November but I did start this book. I will probably finish it today or tomorrow.

### Elevation
Congratulations Stephen King for winning the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-horror-books-2018">10th annual Goodreads Choice Awards Horror category</a>! While it wasn't my choice for the horror books, I'm still glad it showed up. It's a short book and shows the master of words still hasn't lost his tongue.

I liked <em>Elevation</em> mostly because it allows you to experience a smaller conflict, while a larger one is enfolding and you're mind is taken away from that all the time. I wouldn't really call it a horror story, but if I were you I'd read it. Go pick it up!

### Craven Manor
Here's the horror book I voted on in the 10th annual Goodreads Choice Awards Horror category. I'm not joking! Although I didn't like <em>Craven Manor</em> as much as I liked <em>Elevation</em>, story-wise, it's more a horror story to me. There's a lot of crazy stuff going on and Darcy Coates knows how to turn you into a page turning machine!

If you like horror books, this is what you need to get. It's not as good as <em>HEX</em> by Thomas Olde Heuvelt, which was just outstanding, but <em>Craven Manor</em> is still very much worth picking up. If you want a modern horror book, this one's waiting just for you.

### Super Mario
How I have spent parts of my life with Super Mario! I remember owning a Game Boy and playing Mario day in and out. That is, until Pok√©mon got out. Anyway, I'm happy I was able to relive part of my childhood moments while reading this awesome book about an Italian plumber!

While this book doesn't really teach you a lot, it holds a lot of funny facts. You can impress your friends by stating you know which was the first Mario game and what his name was back then. Or how Nintendo created their biggest opponents in the Gaming Industry. If that's the kind of book you like, this one is fun and perfect for you!

### The Forbidden Door
I've been following Jane Hawk for some time now and Dean Koontz is writing these books at a pace that feels unhumanly. He's writing about 3 books every 2 years for this series alone! I disliked book number 3, <em>The Crooked Staircase</em>, and I figured his pace of writing might have something to do with it. He proved me wrong.

<em>The Forbidden Door</em> is a perfect example how to keep long-running series interesting. Instead of Jane Hawk being the hunter, she is turned into the hunted. Most of the events of this book don't even involve Hawk, although she is the cause of them. This really is a fun book and got my hopes up for number 5! Pick this up if you like exciting thrillers (but first check out the other 3 Jane Hawk books - duh!). 

### What's Next? December 2018
In my last monthly summary, I noted that I could reach the magical number of 75 books finished in 2018. At the moment of writing, I'm at 73. That means I need two more books. Since I know I won't spend a lot of time reading in December, I'm going to make those two books my reading goal!

I'm gonna finish <em>Brief Cases</em>. I'm quite far in it and I can already spoil that I really enjoy the book. Jim Butcher is such a great author! Next up is <em>The Amityville Horror</em>. This part of the summary really makes me want to dive in and read it: <em>As the author reports, "To the extent that I can verify them, all the events in this book are true."</em> Ain't that awesome???  

So my small reading goal for December is <b>two</b> books. What's yours? And what about the books you read in November, do you think I'd like one of them? Let me know by leaving a comment below!
