title: 'Review: Francine Prose - Reading Like a Writer'
description: 'What would it be to not read for enjoyment, but for something else. Not just to learn something, but to get better in the art of writing. I asked myself that question after I found this book. And I understand now what Francine Prose is saying. There are many ways to improve your writing. But learning from your idols might be the best way to do so.'

There are a lot of good stuff in this book. Mostly, I try to take two or three lessons from each non-fiction book I read. From this one, I&#8217;ve taken about six. That&#8217;s really, really great. An example is that Francine Prose explains that each word, not each sentence or each paragraph but each <b>word</b> should be conveying information. That is strong. I like that.

I guess the balances in the universe work so that for all the good things in this book, there also needs to be at least some bad things. I had one sorrowful moment when I lost track of a chapter because one of the many examples was actually a very long example as well. I&#8217;m talking multiple pages. It took the flow out of the chapter, sadly enough.

All in all, I&#8217;m really happy that I&#8217;ve read this book. Not everything in it is new, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to be reminded of those teachings. However, with great advice comes great examples. As in <em>big</em> examples. Still, for me this is a ✩✩✩✩ book!
