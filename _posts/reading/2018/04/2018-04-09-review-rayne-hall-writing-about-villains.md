title: 'Review: Rayne Hall - Writing About Villains'
description: 'Sometimes I read books about my work. Most of the times, I read fiction stories. And lately I&#8217;ve also been reading about writing. I&#8217;ve even started it. I read <em>Writing Fight Scenes</em> and was really happy with it. Rayne Hall apparently has a lot more writing help books.'

<em>Writing About Villains</em> is a book that helps you improve your villains. Do your villains need a better background story? Ever feel like something&#8217;s missing for them? This book helps you with that! There are several questions you can ask that make you think about the character.

I&#8217;ve used this information for my own book and I&#8217;m really happy with the results. You read that right, results! And that&#8217;s the only spoiler I&#8217;m giving. Hah!

I really liked this book. It does really good what it promises. I even think this one is more useful than the one about fighting scenes. For me, this is definitely a 5 star book.
