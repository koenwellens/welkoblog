title: 'Review: Luke Hohmann - Innovation Games'
description: 'I saw Luke Hohmann give a keynote in Scotland last year. What he said triggered a lot of things in my head. I already knew he had written a book and I was already a fan of it, but I hadn&#8217;t really taken the time to read it. Mostly, I used his games from materials I found online. Time to do what I do best, I thought. I read the book!'

<em>Innovation Games: Creating Breakthrough Products Through Collaborative Play</em> contains a lot of information. There are guidelines on how to play the twelve games the book describes, as well as why to play them. There&#8217;s even tens of pages committed to making sure you treat your customers well!

While I knew the games already, it was nice to read how Hohmann thinks they should be played. Another concept that I liked was the entire team that leads the game, instead of one person. I&#8217;m mostly used to playing the games in a retrospective, with just one person leading it.

I love how much structure there is in this book. It&#8217;s easy to read and easy to understand. I rate the book 4 stars because for having a lot of structure, some pages were still overly filled. But I like the examples Hohmann uses as well as the content of the book.
