title: 'Review: Ralph van Roosmalen - Doing It!'
description: 'I&#8217;m a fan of modern management strategies. Mostly because they imply a more agile mindset. Therefore, I am happy to read books like <em>Managing for Happiness</em> by Jurgen Appelo. His book really was an eye-opener. When I found out Ralph van Roosmalen added content to it, by writing his own book, I just had to read it.'

Each chapter in this book contains examples on how Ralph implemented the methodologies as defined by Jurgen Appelo. What I liked a lot about it, is that Ralph explains that this might not work on your team. It&#8217;s just an idea on how you can implement these things. If you do the same, don&#8217;t forget to tweak it. Because what works for his team, might not work for yours.

There&#8217;s not really much more I can say about this book. If I would, I&#8217;d dive into the content and spoil it. Please read this book if you are interested in Management 3.0. It&#8217;s great, Ralph is very funny and the examples are practical and interesting. For me, this is a ✩✩✩✩✩ book!
