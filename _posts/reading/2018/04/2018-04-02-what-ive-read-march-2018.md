Here&#8217;s an overview of the books I read in March. My average score wasn&#8217;t too high.

## First off, some excuses

I haven&#8217;t finished my e-books last month. I had planned to read <em>Innovation Games</em> and <em>Writing About Villains</em>, but I&#8217;m only two thirds into <em>Innovation Games</em> at the moment. So I&#8217;ll take those with me to April!

## The Never Hero

I spent the transition from February to March reading <em>The Never Hero</em>. This was a fun first book of a trilogy. There&#8217;s a lot of potential in the story. But it&#8217;s missing things. There&#8217;s a lot of blank spots, that I hope will be filled in later.

I guess what I missed most, was anyone in the book calling the protagonist, or anybody else, the never hero. Then why is the book called that way? We haven&#8217;t really learnt that yet. I&#8217;ll keep you up to date whether you should read this trilogy.

## Vanguard

A book that was too long for its story, was <em>Vanguard</em>. It was my first space book in a long while. And that was fun. There&#8217;s not much new in this book. If you&#8217;ve read some space stories, chances are you&#8217;ve read the premise of this one. Sad to say, this book isn&#8217;t really worth reading.

## The Passage

It was time for me to read a good book. Not just a good book, one that would grip me from start to end. I found it in <em>The Passage</em>. It&#8217;s great! I think Cronin is influenced by Stephen King, because it certainly read like a Stephen King story in the beginning.

There&#8217;s a confusing part in the middle, I think. But after that, the story is great. It warms you up for a few more stories in that weird, post-apocalyptic world. I can&#8217;t wait to read the next book! And you should too!

## Building Evolutionary Architectures

In my job, there&#8217;s a lot to do about architectures. No, I don&#8217;t mean the way buildings or bridges are build. I&#8217;m talking about software. Where we used to create one architecture to last an eternity &#8211; or so it was believed &#8211; we now need to focus on the ever-changing real world. And we need to be capable of dealing with it.

<em>Building Evolutionary Architectures</em> is not the best book I&#8217;ve read about the subject. There&#8217;s some physics talk and some commercials for the authors. There&#8217;s some things in this book that are useful. But a lot of it is common sense. You can read this for some extra information, but don&#8217;t expect to learn a lot from it.

## The Chalk Man

Another promising book was <em>The Chalk Man</em>. It started great. And purely psychologically, this is a great book. But there&#8217;s something missing in this book. The story was quite predictable. That was sad. But still, this is fun book. Go and read it. You&#8217;ll see!

## Eenmalige Zonde

One of the books I found in a book market recently, was <em>Eenmalige Zonde</em>. A Dutch translation from Stephen King&#8217;s <em>Blockade Billy</em>. The first story is <em>Morality</em>. There are better King stories. There&#8217;s mystery, but it lacks plot.

The second story in the book is <em>Blockade Billy</em>. This story shows that King can grip you with any story. The ending was quite unspectacular though. If you like King books, you should read it. Otherwise, don&#8217;t go for it. It&#8217;s not that great.

## Agile Coaching

Because of my illness, I wasn&#8217;t able to read much. When I got a bit better, I decided to finish a book that I started in over a year ago. <em>Agile Coaching</em> was a great book. Everyone who is interested in either agile or coaching should read it. I mean that.

## Red Sparrow

I ended my month reading a story that has been turned into a movie. <em>Red Sparrow</em> had a lot of talk about it. And the book was a best seller. It&#8217;s about spies. Since I&#8217;m a spy/action fan &#8211; thank you very much, Evan Smoak &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t wait to read this book.

There are a lot of shortcomings in this book. First off, it&#8217;s way too long for the story. There is too much buildup and a lot of it is waste. A lot of times, it feels like this book is an erotic thriller more than a spy thriller. Not my taste. Don&#8217;t pick this one up unless you have to.

## What&#8217;s Next? April 2018

I didn&#8217;t reach my goal in March. I put it at 9, but I only read 8. It&#8217;s okay, i&#8217;ll make up for it in April. I set my goal at 8 again this time. I know I can manage that! So let&#8217;s look at the books I want to read in the next month.

So what&#8217;s in there? We see <em>Innovation Games</em> and <em>Writing About Villains</em> are back. They&#8217;ve just walked over from March. There are some non-fiction books, like <em>FIRE, Building Microservices</em> and <em>Reading like a Writer</em>. There&#8217;s <em>The Twelve</em>, the follow-up book of <em>The Passage</em> that I&#8217;ve read in March. And there&#8217;s <em>Starship Troopers</em>. Oh I can&#8217;t wait to read that. The animated series and movie always had me siked when I was a kid!

How have you done in March? Did you reach your reading goal? And have you set one for April? Let me know!
