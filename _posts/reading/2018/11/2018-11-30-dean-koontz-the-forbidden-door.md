description: "I wanted to give this review sooner but I've had so much on my mind lately... Anyway, I remember not really enjoying the previous instalment, <em>The Crooked Staircase</em>, as much as the previous books in the Jane Hawk series. When I found out the pace at which Dean Koontz is writing these books, I was a bit worried. What will these books become? Let's find out!"

We return to the world of Jane Hawk. After book number 3, she now has to get to her son before her enemies find him. Will she be able to do that? And what about her <em>followers</em>? Will the people that trust her pay for that? We find out in this story.

I really liked this book. Where the third instalment let me down, this one was superb. Instead of Jane Hawk being the hunter, she is turned into the hunted. The book was written from that perspective and it gives the readers more insights in how the people hunting her are feeling and thinking.

Koontz has a great way of developing characters. There's not really a lot of development for the main characters but that is okay. I guess I was expecting that too much from <em>The Crooked Staircase</em>. Instead, Koontz chose to develop the people hunting down Jane Hawk. You understand their reasoning and, in some wicked way, feel with them over the events happening. Also, Koontz has a funny side to him. Read the book and if you don't know what I mean by the ending, I'll explain it to you.

Of course, the series has some technological flaws. But that doesn't have to mean the stories are bad. Instead, Koontz lets us enjoy this big storyline through feeling and passion. And mystery. 

This book contains such a good story for the Jane Hawk series. For me it's worth ✩✩✩✩! I'm really looking forward to part 5: <em>The Night Window</em>. It's expected to be published in May 2019 and I can hardly wait!
