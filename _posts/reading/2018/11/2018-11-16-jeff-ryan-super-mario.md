This book is a treasure: it contains so many fun facts about history's funniest - if not most famous - video game character. I have learnt so many things. Like, did you know how Mario got his name? Or when the un-official super mario holiday is? If you do, nice! If you don't, read this book. You'll be amazed and smiling a lot!

I've learnt that the strategy Nintendo used has its benefits and disadvantages. I myself don't see me use the strategy a lot because it's not collaborative. Yet, I understand how it made Nintendo so big and how it makes them still a key player in the gaming industry today.

The author has made this book very accessible to read. You don't need to know about technicalities and you don't need to play games to understand what he's saying. There's some pop culture references and I can appreciate that very much.  

Although I haven't learnt a lot of practical stuff from this book, I did have a great time reading it and learnt some fun Mario facts. Hence, these ✩✩✩✩ are well deserved! 

Did you read <em>Super Mario</em>? Did you like it as much as I did? Or were things missing for you? Let's chat about it in the comments section!
