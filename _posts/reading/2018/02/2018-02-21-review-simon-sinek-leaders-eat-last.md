title: 'Review: Simon Sinek - Leaders Eat Last'
description: 'Hooray, I found a better book today! I read <em>Leaders Eat Last</em>. I should have known it would be a good book, as it&#8217;s written by Simon Sinek. The author of <em>Start With Why</em> is good at leadership. Here&#8217;s my review of his book about leaders and, interestingly enough, eating.'

Simon Sinek has done his homework. For a lot of the points he wants to make, he has great real-life stories. There is a lot of good advice in this book. Everything makes perfect sense.

At one point in the book, Sinek lost me. There was a lot of talk about generations. But then he made his point, and it was all so clear. This is a great book about leadership. Nothing more needs to be said.

As you can imagine, I rate this book 5 stars. A leadership book every leader should read. It really is great!
