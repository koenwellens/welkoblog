title: 'Review: S.J. Scott & Rebecca Livermore - Level Up Your Day'
description: 'I read this book before, during and after I read <em>When</em>. There are similarities between what Daniel Pink is saying and what Scott and Livermore tell. So that was a funny observation. Because I hadn&#8217;t planned at all for it to work out like that. Anyway, I just finished <em>Level Up Your Day</em>. Here&#8217;s what I think of it.'

This book does its best to learn you valuable things. Like, if you have a &#8220;what should I do now&#8221;-moment, you can use that time to prepare other tasks. This reduces your stress level altogether. By having more time to do what is really important to you, you&#8217;ll become better in it and happier about it.

Or how about this: when you are feeling like you don&#8217;t want to do a task, why is that? Is it because you don&#8217;t like it? If so, do you really need to do it? If you do like the task, dig deeper. Are you too tired? Because that you can work on. As is described in this book.

They also explain habit chaining. This is a cool idea that allows you to create small habits and chain them to habits you already have at the moment. So they become part of your routine.

While this book was useful, I think in the end there was a bit too much repetition. After the last page, I felt I had read some things more than three times in this book. That&#8217;s sad. But apart from that, this is a really good book. 4 stars, I&#8217;d say.

Have you read <em>Level Up Your Day</em>? What are your thoughts?
