description: 'As you may or may not be aware, I&#8217;m writing a blog post series called <em>Reading 101</em>. In this series, I&#8217;ve discussed excuses people use to not become page-turning addicts. I&#8217;ve talked about some genres, also providing the authors that I like in those genres. There are different kind of books: paper books, e-books and audiobooks. All these have their own advantages and disadvantages. Last but not least, there was a post about all the different places I read my books.'

So what&#8217;s left? Let&#8217;s have a look at how we can create a reading habit for you. This post takes inspiration from <em>The 8-Minute Writing Habit</em>, a book written by Monica Leonelle. Let&#8217;s have a look!

## 8 Minutes

What Monica Leonelle preaches, is that people can create a habit by just doing something every day. If you start doing something, in this case <b>reading</b>, a lot, then it turns into a habit. That&#8217;s the idea.

If we start habits small, we can grow them. Start by reading your book 8 minutes each day. That&#8217;s all I ask. This small amount of time isn&#8217;t a lot in your day. It&#8217;s less than an episode of your favourite series. It&#8217;s more than the time you need for eating a cookie. So it&#8217;s the perfect mix!

## No Time Like the Morning

As I always like to say: there is no time like the present. So why don&#8217;t you think about that next time you wake up in the morning? We humans mostly have more energy in the early hours than after a long, stressful day at work. So we might be too tired to read after our job. We can still work on our reading habit if we do it in the morning.

Monica Leonelle gives the advice to even put your alarm clock 15 minutes earlier. Because 15 minutes isn&#8217;t too long, right? I don&#8217;t do that. I think there is time enough in one day to spare 8 minutes, given the different kinds of books there are. If you don&#8217;t have the time to read, get an audiobook. It&#8217;s really easy and fun!

In this shorter post in my blog post series, I&#8217;ve discussed Monica Leonelle&#8217;s advice on creating a habit. Let&#8217;s put this to action. In the next blog post, we&#8217;ll go through ways you can achieve success and victory in this page-turning competition!

Do you read daily? When do you do it and how long? Let me know via a tweet or a comment!
