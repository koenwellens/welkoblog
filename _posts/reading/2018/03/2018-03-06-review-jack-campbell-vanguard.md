title: 'Review: Jack Campbell - Vanguard'
description: 'It has been a long time since I’ve read a deep space book. What’s a deep space book, you say? A story that happens in space, but not close to us. Like Vanguard. Or Hyperion, which I liked very much. I thought it was time to have another look at this kind of books. Why? More on that soon…'

  Anyway, I’ve read <em>Vanguard</em>. Here’s my review!

  <em>Vanguard</em> starts with a lot of explanation and character development. A bit too much, if you ask me. That’s one of the things I dislike about this book: I think it could have been much shorter. A lot of text looks like waste to me. Anyway, you get a good overview of how humanity has started colonising other planets. Here’s a new idea: we suck at it. Oh wait, that’s not new.

  While I do like the story and setup, it all just feels too far-fetched for me. Criminals are popping up at seemingly random star systems. Everybody hates Reds. There are other examples in the book. While these behaviours are explained, they just don’t feel right when reading. A lot of times, I had a “but, why??” feeling.

  This is the first book of the Genesis Fleet series, according to Goodreads. I’m not sure that I’m going to continue it. Whenever I read a book from a series and don’t necessarily want to read the next book, that’s not a good sign. Hence, I give this book 3 stars. I enjoyed my time for reading it, but it could have been half the time. And it could have warmed me up for the next instalment more.

  Sorry <em>Vanguard</em> fans. Do you disagree? Leave a comment! Or have you read the book and have similar feelings about it as me? Your opinion is highly appreciated!
