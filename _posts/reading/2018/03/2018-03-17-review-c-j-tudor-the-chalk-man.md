<em>The Chalk Man</em> starts promising. With a dead girl. Then it flips back and forth between 1986 and 2016. Which in the beginning can be quite confusing. However, Tudor does a good job here. She makes it explicit. If you don&#8217;t believe me, <b>read the chapter titles</b>.

So, was <em>The Chalk Man</em> good? Yes. Was it predictable? I&#8217;m afraid to say it. Yes. Even though I got carried away, which is definitely a good thing, I also found the plot quite easy to foresee. Whenever there was a loose end, there were also enough hints to point out who had done it.

Because that&#8217;s basically what this is. Nothing more than a modern whodunnit. The factor that makes it complex is the shifting in time. Anyway, if you want to know for yourself there&#8217;s only one thing to do. Read it. I rate it 3 stars by the way. Not super, but I enjoyed it.
