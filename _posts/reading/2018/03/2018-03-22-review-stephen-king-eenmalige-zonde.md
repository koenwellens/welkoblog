That said, I managed to finish a book today. Between resting, trying to work which failed and led me back to my bed, I finally got to read a bit.

A while ago, I went to a book festival where I bought some cheap books that I really want to read. One of them was a Dutch translation of <em>Blockade Billy</em>.

This book starts with a short story called <em>Morality</em>. This was not King&#8217;s best story. It&#8217;s short and simple. There&#8217;s this touch of mystery in it, but it&#8217;s not played out well and gets lost in its shortness.

Then there&#8217;s <em>Blockade Billy</em>. This story proves that Stephen King can hook your attention for anything. He can get you through pages and pages of baseball terms for a conclusion that&#8217;s quite sad. Not in the emotional way. Given the length of the story and the large buildup, I assumed the ending would be more spectacular. It wasn&#8217;t.

In the end I&#8217;m glad I read this because I would have anyway. I&#8217;m also not happy because I was fairly disappointed. I rate this book  stars, which is probably the lowest I&#8217;ve ever rated Stephen King. Oh please don&#8217;t hate me, mr. King. I&#8217;m still a Constant Reader.

Have you read <em>Blockade Billy</em>? How did you find it? Let me know in the comment section below!
