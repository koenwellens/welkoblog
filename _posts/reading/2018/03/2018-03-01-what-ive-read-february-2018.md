March is gonna be big. I can feel it. The sky is the limit. But can it be better than the 10 books I read in February? Here&#8217;s a small overview of those books anyway.

## The Fire in Fiction

In January I&#8217;ve written some books about writing. I don&#8217;t see why I should stop. Especially since I&#8217;m now making the dream happen. <em>The Fire in Fiction</em> is another book with great advice. Donald Maass gives tips and tricks that are not only good, but useful as well.

What I like most about this book is that it includes so much parts of other books. Books that I&#8217;ve read even. To show you what works. To give examples on how it should be done. I consider this book a gift for any writer.

## Change Agent

Another Daniel Suarez book, another one I must read. That&#8217;s what I thought when I picked up <em>Change Agent</em>. In this techno-thriller, Suarez takes it up to a next level. Instead of talking about real-life threats like drones or evil software; Instead of writing about could-have-been technologies hidden by a rogue government organisation, this book is in the future. The near-future.

What if they could change your DNA? What if you could be yourself one day, look like a supermodel the next day and have the appearance of a business man the other day? Sounds crazy, right? Not if you read this book. You&#8217;ll be so drawn in to it, it&#8217;s a shame that it ends. Or does it?

## A Better World

The Brilliance saga is a good collection of stories. What&#8217;s that? It&#8217;s a <b>great</b> collection of stories. Mainly, it&#8217;s one big plot. There are many twists. Many characters. There&#8217;s so much going on that you&#8217;ll be wondering why this story has never been on your radar before.

I&#8217;ve become a fan of Marcus Sakey. If you love stories about people in different perspectives, with subplots and characters that behave less than you&#8217;d expect, read this book. It&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s interesting. But most of all, it&#8217;s realistic.

## When

Time for a non-fiction book! Ever since I read <em>Drive</em>, I&#8217;ve been convinced that Daniel Pink is a good author. He does not let down in his latest collection of words. This masterpiece will explain you the importance of timing, the psychology that goes with it and some funny anekdotes along the way. Well worth the read!

When you should read it, you might ask? Now, of course. There&#8217;s no time like now when it comes to picking up this book!

## Level Up Your Day

While I was learning when to take decisions and things like that, I was also growing habits. <em>Level Up Your Day</em> explains just that. How can you create habits that stick. What is okay, what works and what is worth trying out. A lot of tips are in this book, which you might want to read if you feel like you can use some more structure in your life.

## Hellbent

After some non-fiction, it was time to go back to a non-existent world. This time I got to read what I&#8217;d been looking out for since almost a year. The last instalment of the Orphan X series. That&#8217;s what this is. And it&#8217;s great!

Follow Evan Smoak as he becomes filled with revenge. His mission seems simple. Kill the bad guys. Take revenge. Let there be blood. But then comes the surprise: he&#8217;s not alone. He needs to look out for people who are also on the run. And then there&#8217;s his job as the nowhere man. I wanted to finish this book in one go. You should really read this series. It&#8217;s so awesome!

## Blockchain

I read a small book about <em>Blockchain</em> after that. It&#8217;s a good introduction in the topic, but it didn&#8217;t provide me the technical details that I had hoped for. Since then, I&#8217;ve been looking for a better book and I think I&#8217;ve found it. It&#8217;s coming out in March, so be sure to keep an eye out for a Blockchain book on this blog soon!

## Leaders Eat Last

Another non-fiction author that I really like is Simon Sinek. I read his book <em>Start With Why</em> as one of the first books since I found my bookaholism again. And I thought it was brilliant. With that in mind, my hopes were high about this book. Would <em>Leaders Eat Last</em> be as promising as his previous writing?

This book is so worth it. I can talk hours about it now, but it&#8217;s best if you read it yourself. Every leader needs to read this. I am especially blown away by NextJump. Why? Read this book, find out and tell me you&#8217;re not amazed. I dare you.

## Written in Fire

I couldn&#8217;t help it. I just had to finish the Brilliance Saga. After Sakey responded to me on Twitter, I wanted to know what would <em>mess me up</em>. I found out. It left me broken, unsure and desperate. Nah, just kidding. I&#8217;m really happy that I read this trilogy. It&#8217;s great!

Read this trilogy! It is so good!

## Option B

<em>Option B</em> is it. The first book in years that I haven&#8217;t finished&#8230; There&#8217;s not a lot to say about it. It just was nothing for me. If you need help after you&#8217;ve lost someone, I guess you might find support in this book. But you might also find the COO of Facebook talking a lot about the problems she had. Hey, if you like that, who am I to judge?

## What&#8217;s Next? March 2018

I wanted to read 5 books in January, it became 11. Then I said I&#8217;d read 8 more in February and it turned out to be 10. I&#8217;m really not confident that I can keep this up. Let&#8217;s put the goal for March at 9 books. If I overachieve again, I&#8217;ll raise my goal even more!

That&#8217;s a lot, isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;m almost through <em>The Never Hero</em>. And I see <em>Innovation Games</em> and <em>Writing About Villains</em> have blue covers. They&#8217;re both non-fiction books, so that also fits! <em>Red Sparrow, The Passage, Vanguard</em> and <em>The Never Hero</em> are all books that are part of a series. Stephen King&#8217;s book, <em>The Chalk Man</em> and <em>Building Evolutionary Architectures</em> are stand-alone. A perfect match!

I am uncertain how long I can keep this up. But what about you? What is your goal for March? And what have you read in February? I&#8217;m curious here. Let me know!
