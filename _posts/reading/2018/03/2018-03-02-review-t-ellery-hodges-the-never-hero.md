description: 'I am a sucker for heroes. If you didn&#8217;t know it yet, you do now. I really like a good superhero story. It&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a giant Marvel fan and why I still like comics a lot. I&#8217;ve read a lot of great superhero books over the years. Some lesser works have also passed through my hands.'

I found <em>The Never Hero</em> a while back. A friend of mine had read it and liked it. I decided to give it a try.

This book contains an origin story. It shows the creation of the Never Hero, Jonathan Tibbs. How he received his superpowers and how he learnt to live with them. That background is nice, although there is a lot left unanswered in this book. It&#8217;s definitely part of a series, otherwise there wouldn&#8217;t be so much subplots going on.

Although I think this story has a lot of potential, I&#8217;m not sure that it all came out. The origin story is necessary, but feels too long. We know how Tibbs received his superpower, although we&#8217;re left in the dark about the details. And worst of all, for me personally, <em>The Never Hero</em> is never used in the book. Nobody calls him that. Missed opportunity there, if you ask me.

All in all, I liked the opportunities this story creates and I will surely read its follow-up book <em>The Never Paradox</em>. But I can&#8217;t give this book more than 3 stars. There&#8217;s just a lot missing to make it great for me. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s bad. This is still quite a good book, you know!
