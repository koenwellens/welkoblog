### Missed Opportunities
I've started reading about <em>The Ajax Dilemma</em> and I've also finished <em>The First Days</em> by now. I didn't get to <em>Confessions of a D-List Supervillain</em> and that's not going to change soon. I've had enough of superhero stories for a while!

### No Turning Back
A bunch of friends get together for a diabolical plan that will turn their lives upside down. A book filled with a predictable if not likable story. That's the summary of <em>No Turning Back</em> if you ask me!

I've read some Marcus Sakey books before and I must say he's really good at character development. His stories grip you, even though at some point you might know what's going to come. It makes it all the more painful for some characters. This is a fun read, try it if you like!

### Make It Stick
I will admit that I actually didn't want to read this book in the beginning. I kind of mixed it up with a different one that has a similar title. Yet I was very happy with the eventual read. It gave me a lot of stuff to think about and opens up the learning perspective from an industrial point of view.

If you want to learn more about learning, like what the good techniques are and stuff like that, this is a book for you. And no, it's not for kids or for students. It's meant for everybody. Go find it!

### What's Next? October 2018
At the time of writing - <em>I know, I'm a bit late with my monthly summary</em> - I've already finished <em>The First Days</em>. I'm about halfway through <em>The Ajax Dilemma</em>. So, to not overestimate my next reading goal I have to think carefully.

Let's go over the categories. I've already finished my horror story - <em>more on that soon</em> - and I'm reading a standalone non-fiction book called <em>The Ajax Dilemma</em>. The first one I mentioned is part of a series so I can also cross that off the list! The third book on the list is <em>The Only Rule Is It Has To Work</em>. I've got <em>Terminal Rage</em> on my mind as well as <em>Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked</em>.

My reading goal for October is <b>five</b> books. Again, but this time I mean it! What is your goal? And what did you read in September? Let me know by leaving a comment!
