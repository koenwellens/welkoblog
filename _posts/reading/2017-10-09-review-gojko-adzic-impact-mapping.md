title: 'Review: Gojko Adzic - Impact Mapping'
description: 'Last week, I was at Lean Agile Scotland. This work-related conference was a bulls-eye for me. It was fun, I learnt a lot and hope to use what I&#8217;ve learnt at my job. What I also got, was a goodie bag. Through this bag we were given a copy of <em>Impact Mapping</em>. This book by Gojko Adzic had come across me once already. Since I was in Scotland and had spare time in the evening, I decided to read the book immediately.'

This book is extremely useful. It explains the technique of Impact Mapping, as well as the things you need to know when applying it. There&#8217;s great graphics that express what the text is trying to say. And it is concise, just like this blogpost. All the info you need is in there. It&#8217;s a great reference.

I&#8217;m looking forward to use this technique. I had already heard of it but hadn&#8217;t really come to checking it out. I&#8217;m very glad that I have. I rate this book 5 stars as it contains everything you need about the topic to get started.

Have you read <em>Impact Mapping</em>? If not, you can find more information here. If you have read it, what did you think of it? Let me know in the comment section below.
