title: 'Review: Gregg Hurwitz - The Kill Clause'
description: 'After reading <em>Orphan X</em> and <em>The Nowhere Man</em> from Gregg Hurwitz, I decided to look at other series he&#8217;s written. And so I came along the Tim Rackley series. Now, I&#8217;ve always liked the books from Hurwitz. Even before I read his amazing Orphan X series. Here&#8217;s my review of <em>The Kill Clause</em>.'

I&#8217;m used to some action thrillers and I know one when I read one. This book has all the action it needs to be a great book. You can really see how Hurwitz practiced before starting his best books to date. But while Tim Rackley is having the weirdest and hardest days of his life, the persons he deals with feel real. I can&#8217;t explain it better. At character build-up Hurwitz seems to be a natural talent.

Were there only good things about this book? Not really. In the end, it was very predictable. I kinda knew the plot when I was two thirds in the book. But it still read fast though. And it&#8217;s definitely not as good as Hurwitz&#8217; Orphan X series. I just can&#8217;t stop comparing.

I rate this book 4 stars. Although the plot was quite predictable, I really liked the action in this book and the characters. I&#8217;m looking forward to read further in this series.

Have you read <em>The Kill Clause</em>? Or another book from the Tim Rackley series? What&#8217;s your opinion about it? Let me know in the comments section!
