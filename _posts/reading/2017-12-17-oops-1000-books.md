I started adding books to this list in September of 2014. The oldest book that&#8217;s still there,  is <em>Cell</em> from Stephen King. I&#8217;ve started it a few times, but never got to finishing it. Mostly because I hadn&#8217;t taken books as seriously as I&#8217;ve had this year. Maybe next time, things will be different!

Over the years, what I added to the list has changed. In the beginning I added almost every book I found interesting. This day, what I found interesting has changed a lot. And I mostly have a slight look at the rating and reviews of the book. Unless someone told me to read it, then I just add it.

The last book I added is <em>Overcoming the Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Field Guide for Leaders, Managers, and Facilitators</em> by Patrick Lencioni. I&#8217;ve read some of his books already, and this one might help me get better as a facilitator in both my personal as my professional life.

There&#8217;s a lot of series that I want to read. So much non-fiction that can help me in my professional career. A lot of stand-alone books that I came across over the years. And so much more to come&#8230; But I want to read them all. It has become a hobby that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll give up any time soon!

What&#8217;s up with your list? How much books are on it? And which ones? Let me know in the comments section below!
