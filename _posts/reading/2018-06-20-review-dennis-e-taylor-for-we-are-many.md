description: 'What to read if you&#8217;ve got some time to spare? Well, you could just continue with one of the cool series you&#8217;ve just started! Good idea. I did just that! I decided to go for <em>For We Are Many</em>, the second book in the Bobiverse. Here&#8217;s my review.'

This book takes off immediately after the events of <em>We Are Legion (We Are Bob)</em>. The humour in this books doesn&#8217;t seem to get old. The names the Bobs choose, the jokes they make, the sarcasm. It&#8217;s all great! I&#8217;ve had many moments where I literally laughed out loud. People stare at you when you do that in public. Strange.

What I disliked about the first instalment of the series was that it was getting hard to follow. Somehow I did not have that problem in this book. Am I more used to Bob-skipping? Did Dennis E. Taylor build it up in a better way? I don&#8217;t know. All I know is that I didn&#8217;t loose sight of the Bobs.

One minor issue I have with the book: not all subplots are cleaned up at the end. But hey, can you expect that from the second book of a trilogy? I guess not. For me this story is worth ✩✩✩✩✩ stars. I can&#8217;t wait to read the last part! Who knew these space books could be so fun!
