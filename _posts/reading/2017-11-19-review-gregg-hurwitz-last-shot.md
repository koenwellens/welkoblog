title: 'Review: Gregg Hurwitz - Last Shot'
description: 'I&#8217;ve been out some time. Focusing on my sore neck rather than reading books. Now that I&#8217;m better, I went back to achieving my November goal. The next book on my list was <em>Last Shot</em>, the final part of the Tim Rackley series. After the great <em>Troubleshooter</em>, I was hoping for a great finish that could mount up to the spectacular <em>Orphan X</em> series. Here&#8217;s what I think of it.'

Like its predecessors, <em>Last Shot</em> contains a lot of emotion. But where the previous titles in the series were more about Rackley himself, this book provided an emotional tale about other characters. Apart from that, there was a lot of action and suspense in this story.

I love how Hurwitz was able to tie up some lose ends about Rackley. Where the previous books showed some predictability, this instalment held a lot of unforeseen twists. Like the one at the end. Go and read the book if you want more details.

As much as I like Hurwitz writing and the way you can see his evolution through his books, there was something missing in this story. Something that I did find in <em>Troubleshooter</em>. Maybe the problem here was that Rackley&#8217;s opponent merely had no feelings. And so it was harder to connect with him.

This book is not perfect. But that is not a problem. You can read this book and enjoy it still. There&#8217;s a lot going on. Many familiar faces pop up. A lot of spectacular twists. If you&#8217;ve read the other Rackley books, don&#8217;t forget to read this one. It ends the series with a bang. Worth 4 stars!
