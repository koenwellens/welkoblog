## Ace of Shades by Amanda Foody

This Young Adult/Fantasy novel caught my eye. In a good way. I read a quote comparing it to <em>Six of Crows</em>, which I kinda liked. But the premise of this one looks cool. The subtitle is &#8220;Take a card and stake your soul&#8221;. How awesome is that? Expect it to be released on April 10th!

## The Year of the Locust by Terry Hayes

<em>The Year of the Locust</em> has already been delayed a few times. Given that, it might be that it gets delayed again. However, let&#8217;s hope Hayes delivers on the 1st of May. This book looks so promising. Let me just quote the synopsis. I think it says enough.

> &#8220;What Luke discovers on board the Leviathan is that the future of our world is at a deadly tipping point and that only he will be able to stop the cascade of events which are leading them all inexorably towards doom.&#8221;

## The Crooked Staircase by Dean Koontz

I used to have a love-hate relationship with the books written by Koontz. Some were really good. Others left expectations dangling. But ever since I read <em>The Silent Corner</em>, I&#8217;ve been sold for Jane Hawk. This James Bond-esque lady hunts an organisation that drove her husband to suicide. Is it really suicide if you&#8217;re driven to it?

While I still have to read <em>The Whispering Room</em>, I am already looking out to the third and final part of this trilogy, coming out on May 8th!

## The Outsider by Stephen King

As a Constant Reader, I&#8217;m always looking out for new King books. Although I still have some left to read before I can say I&#8217;m all caught up, the premise of <em>The Outsider</em> looks so good. Knowing King, it will be a spot-on plot with great characters. Any book from him is worth looking out for.

The expected publication date for <em>The Outsider</em> is June 5th. I really can&#8217;t wait!
