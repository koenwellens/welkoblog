## 1. Read 60 books

Last year I was able to finish 51 books. I can do better. At least that&#8217;s the positive attitude I want to have. This leaves me with no choice: I will raise my bar. I set my target of the 2018 reading challenge to <b>60</b> books.

What&#8217;s your Goodreads reading challenge for 2018? Raise your bar. Let me know in the comments section!

## 2. Have a more varied book appetite

I&#8217;ve set my reading challenge at 60 books this year. That means I&#8217;ll finish 5 books per month. The last years, I&#8217;ve went through a lot of series, dropping other books to finish those series. I&#8217;d like to make things a bit more strict this year. I&#8217;ll have the following rules each month.

  * I want to read 1 book that is part of a serie. This can be any book for which at least one other book exists in the same &#8220;universe&#8221;.
  * I don&#8217;t want to give up on non-fiction literature. It boosts my professional and personal life. Therefore, I will read 1 non-fiction book each month.
  * Let&#8217;s do something crazy. In 2018, I want to read one themed book every month. What will the theme be? I&#8217;ll change the theme every season (so that it doesn&#8217;t get too dull) and let you know then. You can expect a blog post about the first theme soon.
  * There has to be a standalone fiction book as well. I couldn&#8217;t live with those, right? They&#8217;ve proven so awesome in the previous years.

Of course, there can be combinations. I could read a non-fiction book that&#8217;s part of a serie. Or a fiction book that&#8217;s in the theme I chose. It&#8217;ll be a great challenge! Don&#8217;t you agree?

## 3. Write more blogposts

I&#8217;ve had some months in 2017 where I wrote more than other months. In some months, I was only able to provide you 4 posts. I. Must. Do. **Better. **I will do my best to give you 7 blogposts each month. At least. And I&#8217;ll add some stats about this in next year&#8217;s stats post. Because I think it&#8217;s important. But I won&#8217;t just write things you don&#8217;t want to read. I&#8217;ll do my best to keep my posts full of interesting content.



## 4. Use an improved rating scale

I&#8217;ve never really had a structured scale for rating my books. This resulted in me sometimes regretting my rating after a certain period. So to improve this, I want to make an explicit scale on how I rate my books.



  1. I couldn&#8217;t even finish this book. Ugh. I wouldn&#8217;t even accept this if I received it as a gift.
  2. Wtf? What was wrong with this author? Okay, I finished the book. That doesn&#8217;t mean I get it. Or like it.
  3. Meh. This book was okay-ish. I&#8217;ve read better books. I also read worse. Probably not worth reading again someday, though.
  4. This book was cool. I could talk about it if you want me to. I&#8217;ll provide you with details and recommend it to you, if it&#8217;s the kind of books you like.
  5. Wow. This. Book. Is. <b>AWESOME!</b> I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s over. OMG. Can&#8217;t I start reading it again? I must talk about this book. To everyone! It&#8217;s so amazing!



That&#8217;s my scale. Plus, I&#8217;ll have it on a separate page on this blog. So you can always look back to it! And I&#8217;ll use star icons. Because. Icons.

## 5. Don&#8217;t say &#8220;I can&#8217;t do it&#8221;

I was going through Twitter and found this image. It encapsulates everything I should do more in 2018. It&#8217;s why I push myself to a higher level. Have a look.



What are your new year&#8217;s resolutions? I&#8217;d like to hear about them!
