> &#8220;10 to 1 is a good return. It&#8217;s even better if the 10 includes a trip to Mars.&#8221; &#8211; Dan Ward

I am so happy that I read this book. It&#8217;s awesome. A lot of what it&#8217;s about is common sense, but it&#8217;s written down for you. If you think Ward is misguided, he slams you in the face with a story that shows otherwise. Multiple stories even. Dan Ward explains his stuff in a very original and sometimes funny way.

FIRE is a book everybody who works on SOMETHING, should read. If you have a project, whether it&#8217;s software or not, this is how you should handle it. The result is not what you&#8217;d expect. But we can learn so much from this book.

I love books like this. FIRE is a great book. One of the best I&#8217;ve read in a while. I cannot rate it less than 5 stars. It&#8217;s really an awesome read. And the jokes were funny too.
