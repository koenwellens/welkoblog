title: 'Review: Michael Crichton & Richard Preston - Micro'
description: 'After Michael Crichton passed away in 2008, they found some manuscripts and unfinished books. One of these was <em>Micro</em>, and Richard Preston was chosen to finish it. I am so glad he did. I found out the book doesn&#8217;t get real good ratings, so I was curious. I mean, come on. This was a Crichton book (partially). Here&#8217;s what I think about it.'

<em>Micro</em> begins as a usual Crichton book. There&#8217;s a lot of technical terms in it. Maybe a bit too much in my opinion. It looks like the man was showing off his understanding of biological and biochemical terms. But we know that&#8217;s what Crichton does. It&#8217;s what makes his books so good.

Apart from the overuse of technical terms, I loved this story. Where Preston takes over, the book gets a more adventurous vibe. There are unexpected plot twists, which improve the story again and again. I&#8217;m really happy that I read this book.

I liked the ending of this book. I&#8217;m not going to tell you the details, but I remember thinking: &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s how it should end.&#8221; I don&#8217;t always have that. So apart from an overuse of technical terms, I think the book is great. That&#8217;s why I give it 5 stars, no matter what the other reviewers think or say.
