<em>The Twelve</em> happens five years after <em>The Passage</em>. It&#8217;s great in many ways. First off, the way things are connected is really brilliant. Cronin does a great job with this. Pieces of this gigantic storyline illustrate the great manner of writing this man possesses. Not only that, you can really feel every character. And that&#8217;s a lot. Not only that you can feel them, there seriously are a lot of point-of-views in this story. So many characters for you to experien</em>e.

While I have become a great fan of Justin Cronin, it annoyed me in the beginning of this book that this follow-up story hardly contained any characters that I knew of. What I&#8217;m trying to say is that there&#8217;s a large chunk of the story happening in the year zero, and I was doubting whether I would hear from Peter and Michael and Amy again or I would get to follow a whole new bundle of people.

In the end though, the band got back together. Everything fits perfectly. Although here and there some parts had been left out &#8211; I assume because of the already huge number of pages and because it was obvious what had happened &#8211; I still liked this book a lot. It&#8217;s great.

If you haven&#8217;t read <em>The Passage</em> yet, go. Now. Read! It is a great post-apocalyptic story. The ending leaves you wanting more. That &#8220;more&#8221;, you can find in this ✩✩✩✩ star book. It&#8217;s great, and from what I&#8217;ve read on the webz the last instalment is going to be even better. I can hardly wait to read it.
