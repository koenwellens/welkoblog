title: 'Review: Scott Meyer - An Unwelcome Quest'
description: 'I finished the third part of the Magic 2.0 series. I can only wait for Scott Meyer to finish his fourth book: <em>Fight and Flight</em>. The first book, <em>Off to Be the Wizard</em>, was a great read. <em>Spell or High Water</em> continued where the previous ended, both in story as in style. I really liked that book as well. Now, I&#8217;ve read <em>An Unwelcome Quest</em>, which again joins young wizard Martin Banks on his journey.'

In my review about <em>Spell or High Water</em>, I mentioned the predictability of the storyline. That hasn&#8217;t improved in this book. Sometimes, Scott Meyer seems to explicitly create certain parts of the story so that the outcome is predictable. I&#8217;m not gonna say that it&#8217;s a bad thing or a good thing. I didn&#8217;t think it hurt in his first or second book of the series. I was a bit disappointed by it in <em>An Unwelcome Quest</em>.

I guess I was mostly disappointed about the ending. Without going into details, I can say that the story was going in a good direction. I had a great laugh and really liked the plot. And after finishing it, I just feel like I miss something. Like there was a vibe in the story that got cut short somehow. I can&#8217;t explain it differently.

## Conclusion

I had a great time reading this book. When comparing it to its predecessors, I could just go and give it five stars. However, I feel unsatisfied. Something is missing. Something I just can&#8217;t put my finger on. Therefore, I think a four star rating fits perfectly.
