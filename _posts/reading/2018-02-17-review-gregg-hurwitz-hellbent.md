Orphan X is back. Where previous books left him fighting against people that hunted him, <em>Hellbent</em> shows a different plot. This time, Evan Smoak is the hunter. And he wants blood. In the meantime, he is tested at so many different levels. But is he skilled enough?

This book really has everything. There are closures, openings, plots and subplots. There&#8217;s space for humanity and time for jokes. But most of all, there is revenge. And revenge, as Evan puts it, is a dish best served piping hot. While being the emotional thrilling suspense story _Hellbent _is, it also serves an extra, more bigger purpose. It sets up Evan Smoak on his next mission. Maybe even his biggest yet.

I really enjoyed <em>Hellbent</em>. From beginning to end, this book had me in its grips. Hurwitz proves to master a great set of skills, including character build-up and suspense writing. This book truly deserves 5 stars. Only thing I&#8217;m wondering is why nobody is turning these books into movies yet. Hello, Hollywood? Are you guys paying any attention when you go through Amazon or wander through a bookshop?

Go read <em>Hellbent</em>. If you haven&#8217;t read <em>The Nowhere Man</em> or <em>Orphan X</em> yet, do that first. Then let me know what you think of it. I&#8217;m interested to know!
