title: 'Review: Robert A. Heinlein - Starship Troopers'
description: 'As a kid, I was a huge fan of Starship Troopers. I liked the animated series as well as the movie they created. Although if I look at it today, the movie would probably not mean much to me. Anyway, I found out that it was based on a book. Duh. And then I did what I do best. I read it.'

I remember <em>Starship Troopers</em> like this: military fighting off the most awesome insectoid creatures. The book was something like this: one guy trying to make a career in the military, while giving only few and vague reference to &#8220;bug&#8221; aliens. You can see that my expectations were **not** covered by this.

The story follows Johnny Rico as he grows from boot camp to a full-fledged officer in the force. There is a lot of &#8220;learning&#8221; involved. I believe I counted two action sequences? I could be off by one. Heinlein also creates this idea that only people who have served can vote. That looks absolutely ridiculous to me.

I was very disappointed with this book. It was nothing like what I remembered the animated series or movie to be. I can only give it 2 stars. The second star is because the story did make me feel along with Rico. A bit. And that&#8217;s mostly it.
