title: 'Review: Gregg Hurwitz - Troubleshooter'
description: 'I&#8217;ve been reading quite some Hurwitz books this year. The reason is that I had already read one or two before I found his <em>Orphan X</em> books. And they are awesome. That made me look towards a different series written by the same author. The Tim Rackley series, named after the main character, has shown potential but hadn&#8217;t yet gripped me like <em>Orphan X</em> did.'

Until now.

<em>Troubleshooter</em> is the third instalment of the series. It&#8217;s about biker gangs, terrorism, police employees getting shot or killed and so much more. One thing is sure: this book is packed with action. You follow Tim Rackley as he is put on a case that seems to be the worst case he has had. Ever.

In the beginning of this book, I figured it was quite predictable. I knew part of the story before I actually read it. However, there are twists that make you think &#8220;but hey, isn&#8217;t this or that supposed to happen now?&#8221; And you know it&#8217;s coming. Just&#8230; not yet! You could say that the suspense level of the series has risen to new heights with this book.

I have been doubting about the rating of this book. At certain moments while reading, I figured it was max 4 stars. But as the ending came closer, I was certain this is exactly what drove Hurwitz to the <em>Orphan X</em> series. After finishing it, I can share without a doubt that this book is worth 5 stars! And there&#8217;s another book in the series! Hooray!!

Have you read <em>Troubleshooter</em>? Or another book of the Tim Rackley series? What&#8217;s your opinion of it? Let me know in the comments section!
