title: "Review: Kevin Hart - I Can't Make This Up"
description: 'Sometimes I read fiction. Sometimes I read non-fiction. Most books I read are serious though. Okay, some fiction books make me laugh more than others, but at least the plot is serious. So I doubted what I would do when I picked up <em>I Can&#8217;t Make This Up</em>. This book written by a comedian, was it worth the read? I went to find out. Here&#8217;s my review!'

This really is a good book. I can&#8217;t say it differently. There&#8217;s good advice and funny jokes. Some stuff is so f*cked up, you&#8217;re really wondering whether it was made up or not. But in the end, I believe it. Although he mentioned he didn&#8217;t read any book himself, I seriously doubt that. He is very good at ending chapters with enough tension for you to read the next.

Some things were extremely funny. I actually listened to the audiobook and it is read by Kevin Hart. Which he does great! But while things were funny, there were details I didn&#8217;t need to know. Seriously Kevin, if that man does not show up at my door promising me a million dollars for telling how you lost your virginity I WILL KNOW IT FOR NOTHING. I CANNOT UNKNOW. DAMMIT.

<em>I Can&#8217;t Make This Up</em> is a collection of life lessons and explains the story of Kevin Hart growing to the great stand-up comedian he is today. It is an excellent read. I cannot give it less than ✩✩✩✩✩. It&#8217;s great. Just take my advice and read it, stupid!
