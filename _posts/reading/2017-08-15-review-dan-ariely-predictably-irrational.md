title: 'Review: Dan Ariely - Predictably Irrational'
description: 'We &#8211; humans &#8211; do a lot of silly things. We never stop to think about them, though. Then comes in Dan Ariely. With his ability to think of experiments that outline our behaviour. I was curious to see where this train of ideas would lead, so I read <em>Predictably Irrationa</em>_. It might come to a surprise that I found out that I am also <em>very</em> irrational.'

> &#8220;Suppose we are nothing more than the sum of our first, naive, random behaviors. What then?&#8221; &#8211; Dan Ariely

For a non-fiction book, this one read like a high-speed train. Dan proves that he is funny, scientific and thorough. He furthermore shows that you can explain subjects &#8211; that might not interest everybody &#8211; to everybody if you add in a bunch of (sometimes funny) anekdotes.

While I liked this book, I had trouble keeping my focus at one part. I think the deal was that I already knew what he was saying. Because, on some levels, I do the things Dan Ariely writes about. Moreover, I do them so much that sometimes I knew the outcome of his experiments before I read them.

What does that mean? That I don&#8217;t like the book? Hell no! I&#8217;m just not sure whether I would read it again. Which means, in my opinion, that it&#8217;s not a really _really_ good book. Therefore I rate it 4 stars. Just because I can.
