title: 'Review: Matt Cohen - Blockchain'
description: 'I&#8217;m interested in new technology. But sometimes I&#8217;m a late adopter. Blockchain is such a topic. I&#8217;d like to know more about it, not for its cryptocurrency solutions but for other fields in which it might create new opportunities. For that reason, I read <em>Blockchain: Complete Guide to Understanding the Blockchain Technology Revolution and the Future of Money</em>. Too bad it wasn&#8217;t what I hoped for.'

Cohen gives some explanation on what Blockchain is, but he doesn&#8217;t go deeper than &#8220;it&#8217;s a chain of blocks&#8221;. And I didn&#8217;t need to read this book to figure that out. Sadly enough. The view on blockchain is too high-level for the details that I was looking for.

Most of the book is an economy guide to cryptocurrencies. It provides an overview of the biggest ones out there, as well as a &#8220;guide&#8221; &#8211; <em>A.K.A. common sense</em> &#8211; on how to make money with them. There are a few references to usage of blockchain outside of the financial sector, but they&#8217;re limited.

Overall, this book was not what I expected. The one positive thing: it was very short. I can&#8217;t call it a waste of time because&#8230; it hardly took any time to read. I rate this book 1 star, giving it the worst rating I&#8217;ve given ever on this blog. Auch!

Have you read <em>Blockchain</em> and disagree? Or do you know blockchain books that _do_ explain the technology? Let me know via Twitter or by leaving a comment below!
