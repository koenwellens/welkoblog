description: 'Today, I finished the second book of the Brilliance Saga. After reading Brilliance, I thought this trilogy was pretty cool. I can tell you: I knew nothing. I am so glad I found these books. I should have read this so much sooner. <em>A Better World</em> is a masterpiece. Here&#8217;s my review.'

I remember liking the first instalment of this series. I know Nick Cooper was quite a hypocrite. Though I can relate to him better now, sometimes he&#8217;s still just plain stupid. But he&#8217;s starting to realise that. So that&#8217;s nice.

There are different point of views in this story. Sakey does it so well. You really experience the same as the characters in this book. Whether it&#8217;s a professor on the run, an abnorm preparing an assassination or Nick Cooper, we totally feel with him.

While the plot of <em>Brilliance</em> was cool, the story in <em>A Better World</em> is even better. For me, definitely 5 stars. This book makes you wish it never stops. Thank God there&#8217;s a third instalment. I&#8217;ll surely be reading it soon.

Have you read <em>A Better World</em>? Did you like it too? Let me know in the comments section!
