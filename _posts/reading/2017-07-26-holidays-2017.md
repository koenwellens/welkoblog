Hey guys!

Twenty days ago, I told you I&#8217;d be taking a blogging break. Now that I have my computer back, I can explain what happened. My wife and I went on a roadtrip&#8230; to Canada! It was great. We saw black bears, killer whales and seals.

So while I was on that trip, I didn&#8217;t read as much as I had hoped. The flight to Canada was long. The book I started reading was not so good that I could keep my full attention during the time we were in the air. I therefore took my time reading at times when we were resting. Which was less than I expected. There was just so much to see!

I was quite hopeful in my last post, mentioning seven books I could read. In total, I read four books during our trip. So it might not be what I thought it would, but I&#8217;m still very happy with it. Especially with the books themselves. Most were great!

So in the next weeks, you can expect my reviews of those books. While I was away, what did you do? Let me know in the comments section!
