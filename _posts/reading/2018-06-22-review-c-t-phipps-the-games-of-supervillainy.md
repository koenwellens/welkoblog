title: 'Review: C. T. Phipps - The Games of Supervillainy'
description: 'My theme for the summer is superheroes. And with superheroes come supervillains. I started reading a series called The Supervillainy Saga. The first book was good. Not great. Didn&#8217;t need to be. But since I had some extra time to read, I figured I&#8217;d already start on the second book. I finished it quite fast. Want to know what I thought of it?'

<em>The Games of Supervillainy</em> takes off immediately after the events of <em>The Rules of Supervillainy</em>. The humour and style remain the same. That means it&#8217;s hilarious! It feels like these books are getting better and better. I can&#8217;t wait to read the next one!

A quick note on the importance of chapter titles. C. T. Phipps shows that good chapter titles really add value. Often, I&#8217;m already laughing before I read the chapter. Good job, man. Good job.

This book had everything I wanted. Even the ending was great. I haven&#8217;t felt so much emotions together with a ridiculous character in a long time. Maybe there could have been more character development for the secondary characters, but it didn&#8217;t bother me. I like this book the way it is.

I already know now that I will read all the books in this series. I actually hope there are hundreds. If there aren&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll have to send Merciless (the supervillain without mercy) to C. T. Phipps to demand more books! More books like this ✩✩✩✩✩ instalment of the series, I hope.
