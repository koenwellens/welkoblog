This is one of the messages Ethan Cross tries to tell us. I found this book at a local book fair and I&#8217;m very happy that I did. I hardly come by books that interest me, because those fairs are mostly littered with poor young-adult books.

Here&#8217;s what I think about <em>The Shepherd</em>.

I didn&#8217;t really have high hopes before I opened this book. But then I started reading. One of the first scenes involves a crazy serial killer murdering a victim. He does this in a very bloody way, and it spikes my interest for this book. It was probably the best scene already.

There was a lot of action in this book. But at some point, it got real confusing. The book contains two different storylines. While there&#8217;s the part about Francis Ackerman Jr. who butcherly murders anyone he finds, there&#8217;s also a story about Marcus Williams getting into the Shepherd organisation.

While some parts of the book are great, some are just too hard to believe. Other parts of the story just don&#8217;t work out for me. That&#8217;s the reason why I can&#8217;t give this book more than 3 stars.
