title: 4 Reading Myths Busted
description: 'As I&#8217;m a bit sick and reading a long book called <em>The City of Mirrors</em>, there might not be a review here for a while. So let&#8217;s talk about something else. Sometimes, I hear people say these things about books that make me think either they&#8217;re not from this world or I&#8217;m not. With this post, I&#8217;m hoping that it&#8217;s them.

## 1 Nobody reads nowadays

Haven&#8217;t you heard this one yet? Maybe you even said it yourself. These days, man, there&#8217;s the internet and Netflix and youtube and a lot of cooler things than books. Nobody&#8217;s interested in those.

Errr, wrong! While I cannot give you any statistics about how much people are reading daily or how many books are still sold, I can tell you this: have you been on a train recently? Because I have. Almost everybody I see either has a book or an e-reader. What they do with that? I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re watching Netflix, Sherlock.

## 2 Books are no longer created

Where the hell does this come from? I don&#8217;t know, but some people get the feeling that authors have stopped working. They have &#8220;seen the light&#8221; and just, you know, quit. That&#8217;s not what I see on Twitter though. Many of the authors I follow are still tweeting a lot about them writing. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re creating a book, right?

Then how about we check Goodreads. Like, almost weekly they give as an overview of 7 great books hitting the shelves. All those books are new. Don&#8217;t believe me? Here&#8217;s a link to the last one to date.

## 3 New fiction books only come in series

Okay, there are a lot of series these days. Not only on the screen, also in books. You might have a good point here, albeit that standalone volumes are still created. But you have to look at it from a writer&#8217;s perspective. If you can sign a contract for one book, or you can sign a contract for the first book of a series &#8211; meaning the others immediately have a contract as well &#8211; what would you do?

This year, I&#8217;ve read some standalone novels (like <em>The Woman in the Window</em> and <em>The Chalk Man</em>). They were okay. Really. Don&#8217;t believe me? Go read them. See for yourself.

## 4 Fiction books aren&#8217;t created anymore

Because everywhere you go, you see non-fictions. Amirite?

Come on guys. Don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;ve read this post until here and need me to give further evidence that fiction books still exist. I mean, jeez. While there&#8217;s a lot of non-fiction these days, I think it&#8217;s safe to say there is at least double the amount of fiction out there. Probably more. I don&#8217;t know the numbers.

What have we learnt from this? Not much. Everything in bold is a lie? Yeah, basically!

Do you have any reading myths? Care to bust them?
