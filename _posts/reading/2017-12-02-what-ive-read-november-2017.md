## Missed Opportunities

In my previous post I mentioned reading <em>Paradox Bound</em> as it was very high on my wish list. During the month, I noticed that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to finish it by the end of the month. So I postponed reading that book and went for a different one from the upper regions of the wish list. What did I read instead? Find out below!

## The Outward Mindset

I started the month with the final book by the Arbinger Institute. While the previous instalments followed a single character throughout some kind of workshop, this book offers a collection of stories. The Arbinger Institute has collected many stories through the years. Finally, they shared it with us.

This is one of the best books I&#8217;ve read this year. Just like <em>Leadership and Self-Deception</em>, this book is an eye-opener. It allows you to see things through a different perspective and can change your life. If you haven&#8217;t had the time to pick it up yet, now&#8217;s as good a time as any. Read it and let me know what you think!

## Last Shot

I finished the Tim Rackley series! While this series is not at the same level as the <em>Orphan X</em> books, Gregg Hurwitz proves to own the right writing skills. <em>Last Shot</em> follows Tim Rackley as he is on the tail of the most lethal criminal he&#8217;s ever faced.

I am a Tim Rackley fan. So I like the stories. I wouldn&#8217;t say you <b>need</b> to read this book, but it&#8217;s still good. I don&#8217;t like this book as much as the others, though I&#8217;m happy I read it. If you want a good storyline with lots of action, this series is what you want. Go read and let me know your thoughts on it!

## The Agility Shift

Another month, that means another book on agile. <em>The Agility Shift</em> provides you tips on how to provide an agile shift in mindsets in your company. The book uses the software industry as an example and guides you through difficulties. Not the best book on the subject, in my opinion. But you might like it. If you&#8217;ve read it, leave a comment below!

## Artemis

<em>Artemis</em> and I didn&#8217;t really get along in the beginning. We had some differences in expectations, after reading Weir&#8217;s first book <em>The Martian</em>. Other than that, this book really gets going. There&#8217;s some suspense in there and a bit of humour.

You should know that this book is still only Weir&#8217;s second novel. That means that this is a <b>great</b> book! It&#8217;s just less awesome than <em>The Martian</em>. You can surely enjoy <em>Artemis</em> and I suggest that you do. Right now. Go read!

## What&#8217;s Next? December 2017

I&#8217;ve ended the series that I started this year. So what&#8217;s next? I can read some solo books! Of course, <em>Paradox Bound</em> is one of these. <em>Bird Box</em> is a horror story that&#8217;s been on my list for quite a while now. I&#8217;m also going to read some non-fiction books. <em>Death By Meeting</em> by Patrick Lencioni is one that I&#8217;m really looking forward to.

Just like November, I&#8217;m putting my reading goal on 4. The fourth book will either be <em>How Google Works</em> or <em>Surely You&#8217;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!</em> I don&#8217;t know which one yet, so I won&#8217;t make a decision now.
