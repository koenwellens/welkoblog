> _&#8220;Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is back.&#8221; &#8212; Stephen King_

I remember reading <em>Finders Keepers</em> and thinking it wasn&#8217;t as good as _Mr. Mercedes. _There was a lot of build-up to that story and the plot was so much thinner. But I see now why the book fits in the trilogy. As <em>End of Watch</em> takes place 6 years after the gruesome murders committed by Brady Hartsfield, we needed to know what happened in those years.

What Stephen King failed to do in the second book of the trilogy, he manages perfectly in this one. After the first word, you are swayed into the story. There&#8217;s no waiting and no stopping. I bet you&#8217;ll want to read this in one go. So much is going on at the same time, as what might be the greatest act of Brady Hartsfield unfolds. Can he finish what he started?

People know by now that I am a real Stephen King fan. But that doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t be a critic about his books! It&#8217;s just that there&#8217;s&#8230; not so much to criticise about this one. In my opinion, of course. I really loved it. So I had to rate it 5 stars. What else could I do?

Have you read <em>End of Watch</em>? Or any other books of the Bill Hodges trilogy? What are your thoughts on it? Let me know in the comments section below.
