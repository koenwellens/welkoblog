description: 'As much as I like fiction books, I also want to improve myself. Hence, non-fiction books to the rescue! This time, it was <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> that got my attention. Mostly because the title made me frown. But the ratings were so high. I wanted to know why. Here&#8217;s my opinion.'

This book doesn&#8217;t really tell you how to win friends, but explains what behaviour causes people te like you more often. For instance, if you remember people&#8217;s names they will appreciate you more. Might sound trivial, but do we do this at all times? It&#8217;s small things like this that make other people open up to us&#8230; and how they become friends.

There are a lot of tips in this book. That&#8217;s a plus, because it&#8217;s about self-improvement! But this book also has a lot of content, which makes it slow to read. I guess that&#8217;s the worst thing I can think of about this one. Keep in mind that it was written in <b>1936</b>. And I think all the content is still applicable today.

A lot of the tips given by Dale Carnegie make sense and seem trivial, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re doing them. Anyway, I&#8217;m starting off today with some of the tips Dale Carnegie has written in this book. For the oldest book I&#8217;ve ever read, I give ✩✩✩✩!
