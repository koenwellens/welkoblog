description: 'Yesterday, I was able to continue doing what has been on my mind for quite some time now. Instead of reading parts of a series spread out, when I want to, I&#8217;m now trying to read it sooner. That way I get the full experience of the series.'

For that reason, I read <em>The Program</em>. It&#8217;s the second book in the Tim Rackley series I started reading a while ago. As I already pointed out, this series seems to lay out the foundation for Hurwitz&#8217; Orphan X series. Which is fantastic, by the way. But now, are you ready? To&#8230; GET WITH THE PROGRAM.

I&#8217;m just kidding. I got no program for you. What I do have is a review!

In the beginning of this story, I was let down completely by our main character Tim. Tim Rackley, who has been mind-controlled in killing people in the previous instalment of the series, mentions that he&#8217;s had military training to not subdue to mind-control. I was like&#8230; <b>What</b>? Seriously. The arrogance of the character was so frustrating.

Then I read the rest of the book. It made up for the arrogance. Though I sometimes don&#8217;t feel like I know what Tim&#8217;s wife is doing in this series, I thought most of the characters were pretty legit. Even though the novel is kind of predictable, I was glad with the outcome and happy to have read it.

I rated <em>The Kill Clause</em> 4 stars. And I had good reasons too. I wanted to give this book the same rating but then I started comparing. And <em>The Program</em> is just not as good as its predecessor. Hence, I can only give it 3 stars. I am ready the next instalment, <em>Troubleshooter</em>, though. I&#8217;m sure this series is going to kick some ass in the last two chapters.
