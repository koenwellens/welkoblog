## Missed Opportunities

In my last post, I spoke of <em>The Program</em>. It&#8217;s the second book in the Tim Rackley series. I&#8217;m almost done with the book. I think you can find a blogpost here in the next few days. Again, all other books I mentioned were finished. And I also read a self-help book on Python, the programming language.

## Please Don&#8217;t Tell My Parents I&#8217;m a Supervillain

The first book in the Please Don&#8217;t Tell My Parents series made me aware that superhero books can be bad. I&#8217;ve already noticed this when reading <em>Zeroes</em>, but this story made me see differently. Too bad, because there was so much potential. Too bad, I guess!

Have you read this book? Let me know in the comments section!

## Leadership and Self-Deception

I&#8217;ve read a great book about dealing with difficult situations. What makes us turn people against us? And can we do something about it? <em>Leadership and Self-Deception</em> is a book that everyone should read. This book is not written by a person, but by an institute.

The Arbinger Institute did a <b>great</b> job on this story. I really want to stress this out: this book was not written as a classic textbook, but as a <b>story</b>. It&#8217;s awesome and I really feel that I&#8217;ve learnt a lot from it. So much actually that I&#8217;m planning on reading their next book soon. Like&#8230; really soon! And you should too! If you haven&#8217;t already, go read this book!!

## Fight and Flight

The last book to date in the Magic 2.0 series let me down a bit. <em>Fight and Flight</em> tells the next chapter in the story about the technology wizards. Martin and Philip fight off dragons this time!

Though the humour in this book was in line with the previous stories, I missed something. When I tell what I missed, I&#8217;ll kind of spoil the story. So if you really want to know&#8230; you might find it in a different post on this blog. But in the end, I still look forward to yet the next part of this series.

Have you read <em>Fight and Flight</em>? Or one of the previous parts in the Magic 2.0 series? What did you think of it? Leave me a comment and let me know!

## Python Crash Course

The <em>Python Crash Course</em> book is a fantastic book if you need to learn Python. The basics are explained through a hands-on approach. There are examples on how you can use the programming language in real life as well, with a game and a web application for you to develop.

## What&#8217;s Next? October 2017

Since this summer, I&#8217;m going for a steady goal of 4 books a month. I don&#8217;t see why I want to change that now. That only leaves me with one thing to decide: which books. I&#8217;m definitely going to read the next Arbinger Institute book. I&#8217;m currently finishing up <em>The Program</em>, but I might dig in the next book of the series as well: <em>Troubleshooter</em>. And as the fourth book, I might pick Dean Koontz&#8217; latest story. <em>The Silent Corner</em> has been on my list for a while now.

Alright! Let&#8217;s do this! On to October 2017! What are your goals for the month? I&#8217;d like to know! Share it in the comments section.
