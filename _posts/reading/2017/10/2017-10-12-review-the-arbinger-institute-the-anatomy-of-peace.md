And if you have read it, there&#8217;s <em>The Anatomy of Peace</em>. The follow-up book that further explains the concepts. I just finished it.

<em>The Anatomy of Peace</em> uses the same story-telling technique as <em>Leadership and Self-Deception</em>. Again, the sense of the concepts is explained through relatable stories in both business as private life. It&#8217;s such a great way of reading this content because you can easily see how you can use it.

But where <em>Leadership and Self-Deception</em> followed a character who constantly questions the &#8220;box&#8221; theory, <em>The Anatomy of Peace</em> is about Lou. He is loud-mouthed and arrogant. And for some part of the book, this is okay because he questions the methods as well. However, on the second day he becomes passive. It&#8217;s like he stops thinking.

Overall, I still liked this book. I&#8217;ve learnt that there are different kinds of boxes. And that I have multiple. But I just think the previous book was better. Therefore, I rate this book 4 stars. On to <em>The Outward Mindset</em>.
