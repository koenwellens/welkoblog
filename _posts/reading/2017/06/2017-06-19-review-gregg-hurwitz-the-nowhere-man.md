description: 'Today, I finished another Gregg Hurwitz novel. I read <em>The Nowhere Man</em>, which is the second book of the <em>Orphan X</em> series. As in the first book, Evan Smoak finds himself in an incredible, unbelievable adventure. What starts with as little as a napkin holder, soon turns into the most dangerous mission The Nowhere Man has ever faced. <em>Ball bearings within ball bearings</em>.'

I really liked <em>Orphan X</em>. It was a James Bond-esque story that had your grip from the first page. I was happy that my expectations were met. <em>The Nowhere Man</em> kicks in where <em>Orphan X</em> left off. Not in a sense of time, but in a sense of flow. The way the story goes, it holds you. And only lets you go at the last page.

When I was half through the book, I started wondering about this series. I know it&#8217;s Gregg&#8217;s latest book to date, but will there be next? I found out that there&#8217;d be more books in the series (and according to some guy on Goodreads, at least four!). Yes! Yes, yes yes!

I enjoyed this book. It was what I wanted to read, without me knowing I wanted to read it. The story is great, Evan Smoak is a well-crafted character suited perfectly for the plot he gets thrown into. I can&#8217;t wait for the next Orphan X novel.

If you haven&#8217;t read this book, or it&#8217;s predecessor <em>Orphan X</em>, you should. I&#8217;m going to start a &#8220;Read Gregg Hurwitz books&#8221; campaign, starting today! So if you haven&#8217;t, now&#8217;s the time. They&#8217;re great. <em>The Nowhere Man</em> is an awesome story. Worth 5 stars if you ask me.
