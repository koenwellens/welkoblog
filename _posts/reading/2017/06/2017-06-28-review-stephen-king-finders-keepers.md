title: 'Review: Stephen King - Finders Keepers'
description: '<em>Shit don&#8217;t mean shit.</em> Or at least, that&#8217;s one of the statements that keeps returning in <em>Finders Keepers</em>. I finished it today, the second book of the Bill Hodges trilogy. As you might or might not know, I&#8217;m a Constant Reader. One of those that keep reading Stephen King&#8217;s books. Why? Well, the Master explains it himself in this book.'

I enjoy the way Stephen King can get you to understand why people do certain things. Even psychopaths have a background story that makes sense. The way characters are introduced in Finders Keepers keeps your grip on you. But there&#8217;s a lot of build-up. I noticed when I was almost halfway through the book that we were still working on the background part.

The book reads like a speed train. The characters are great and the plot is worked out perfectly. All the details match and the entire book works out. What I found best about this book, might not be the story itself. In this book there is also a small build-up for the third book. But it is so good. I have no words to explain it.

I really like the series that I&#8217;ve gotten myself into currently. The Bill Hodges trilogy is turning out to be really interesting. I rate <em>Finders Keepers</em> 4 stars. Not five like its predecessor, because the plot was just less good. But the build-up for the third book is extremely well-written.

Have you read <em>Finders Keepers</em>? Or <em>Mr. Mercedes</em>? What are your thoughts on those books or the Bill Hodges trilogy? There&#8217;s plenty of space in the comments section!
