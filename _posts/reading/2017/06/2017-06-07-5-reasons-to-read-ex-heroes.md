I&#8217;ve been thinking about writing a blog post about the series for a while, but didn&#8217;t really know what to say. Today I figured I&#8217;d give it a go and explain to you why <b>you</b> should read the <em>Ex-Heroes</em> series.

## 5. Flashbacks

Peter Clines uses a lot of flashbacks throughout his <em>Ex-Heroes</em> books. It starts in <em>Ex-Heroes</em>, where the origin of the zombies and superheroes is explained. The only part of the series that has no flashbacks is <em>Ex-Purgatory</em>, but it has other great surprises. Want to know which? Get to reading then!

## 4. Zombies

Since the start of <em>The Walking Dead</em> in 2010, zombies have been everywhere. They&#8217;ve been in video games, on tv shows, in different movies and in a lot of books. The <em>Ex-Heroes</em> series also touches this topic. However, the zombies in these books are actually sick, dead people that have died a horrible death from a virus that keeps their muscles working.

## 3. Hollywood

Most of the <em>Ex-Heroes</em> series take place in the lovely neighbourhood of Hollywood. Of course it&#8217;s not so lovely anymore now that it&#8217;s been overrun with zombies. Because of the location, the protagonists of the series play a fun game. They count the celebrity zombies they kill. The one with the highest number, is the winner.

## 2. Superheroes

We&#8217;ve already discussed the zombies part of this crazy mashup that Peter Clines created, so it&#8217;s time to discuss their counterparts. The protagonists of the series are superheroes. With names like The Mighty Dragon, Zzzap, Stealth or Cerberus, you know you&#8217;re in for a whole bunch of superhero fun. They&#8217;re like The Avengers. Only&#8230; different.

## 1. Supervillains

What I liked most about this series is that it has great supervillains. John Smith, PeeZee and Legion are great superheroes. They provide fun storylines and I&#8217;m sure there are more to come. I&#8217;m not going to say more about these antagonists, because I will spoil too much for you. If you want to know more, there&#8217;s an easy solution: read the series! It&#8217;s great!
