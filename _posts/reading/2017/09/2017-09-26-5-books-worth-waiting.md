## Paradox Bound

Peter Clines, author of the <em>Ex-Heroes</em> series, <em>The Fold</em> and <em>14</em>, releases his next book <b>today!</b> Indeed, on the 26th of September! Clines is a master at scientific subjects. If you don&#8217;t believe me, go read <em>The Fold</em> and <em>14</em>. He&#8217;s also funny. And he knows how people think.

Enough about the background information! What&#8217;s up with <em>Paradox Bound</em>?

The newest Peter Clines book is a thriller. Not just any thriller. A thriller about <b>time-travelling</b>. Need I say more? If you want to read the summary, I suggest you go to Goodreads. Don&#8217;t forget to add this book to your list. It looks so promising!

## Artemis

I read <em>The Martian</em> in 2016, and it was probably the best science fiction book I&#8217;ve read that year. On the 14th of November, Andy Weir is back with his follow-up novel <em>Artemis</em>. If you haven&#8217;t read <em>The Martian</em> yet or seen the movie they made from it, then <b>shame on you!</b> Go read! Or go watch if you prefer movies!



Again, this will be a science fiction book. It&#8217;s about a criminal who sees the chance of a lifetime in Artemis, the first city on the moon. Knowing Weir, it&#8217;s going to be a scientifically correct novel. Which is great! Really! I can hardly wait to get my hands on this book. You can find the summary on Goodreads. Don&#8217;t forget to add <em>Artemis</em> to your list!

## Hellbent

I am a huge fan of the Orphan X series. So much that I&#8217;ve even started reading Hurwitz&#8217; earlier series concerning Tim Rackley. The Orphan X books cover the life of Evan Smoak as he shows of his espionage/assassination skills. They&#8217;re Suspense novels. That&#8217;s right, capital S. They belong at the top of the list. If you haven&#8217;t read them, you should <b>really</b> go and do so. They&#8217;re so worth it.



Do you see that cover? It looks <b>AWESOME</b>. Evan will have another tussle with Van Sciver. This time, the book revolves around the last subject of the Orphan program. Gregg Hurwitz has written two masterpieces surrounding Evan Smoak already. My expectations are very high on this book. Not fully convinced yet? Read the summary on Goodreads and add the book to your list!

## The Outsider

Stephen King is getting old. I don&#8217;t mean that he&#8217;s not good at writing books anymore. His last novels, like the <em>Bill Hodges</em> trilogy stories, are still great. And he&#8217;s still writing almost two books per year. As I am a Constant Reader, I&#8217;m always looking out to new King books. Now, King has revealed that he&#8217;s working on a 2018 book called <em>The Outsider</em>. No actual release date has been announced yet, but I&#8217;m already looking forward to it!

## Peace Talks

In 2016, I finished the complete Dresden Files series. I read all 15 books. Looking back on it, it still feels amazing. I really got pulled into it and the last books were the best of the series. As you can suspect, I&#8217;m really <b>really REALLY</b> looking forward to this book. But it&#8217;s not done yet. It might not be named <em>Peace Talks</em> when it&#8217;s finished. All we know right now is what&#8217;s on Jim Butcher&#8217;s website.

> As of August 2017: Jim is back to writing <em>Peace Talks</em>, now that <em>Brief Cases</em> is out the door! We’re still quite a ways from having a release date, but we’ll announce any updates in the news blog.

If you haven&#8217;t read the Dresden Files series yet, I believe you should. Let me point you to the first story on Goodreads. You know what to do from there!
