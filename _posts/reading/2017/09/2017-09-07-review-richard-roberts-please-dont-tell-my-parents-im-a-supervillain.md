title: "Review: Richard Roberts - Please Don't Tell My Parents I'm a Supervillain"
description: 'A while back, I stumbled on a list of superhero books on Goodreads. I don&#8217;t remember which list exactly, but <em>Please Don&#8217;t Tell My Parents I&#8217;m a Supervillain</em> was on it. And as I&#8217;m a big superheroes and supervillains fan&#8230; Well, it was kind of obvious that I would read this book. Here&#8217;s my review!'

> “What kind of supervillains would we be if we didn&#8217;t keep up the drama?”

That&#8217;s actually kind of how I felt when I was reading this book. What the F. The build-up in this book was long and ridiculous. I actually thought I would stop reading the book after the first hundred pages. Then I found a review that said those pages were &#8220;already great, but then the real story starts&#8221;. So I didn&#8217;t give up on this story yet. Luckily I didn&#8217;t!

The story really started after the long build-up and almost turned into a good one. Almost. There were predictable plots and, again, ridiculous characters. These kind of ruined the rest of the book for me. That, together with the fact that the beginning was a real letdown, made me doubt whether it was a right choice to read this book.

Given the things I wrote down above, I can&#8217;t give this book more than 3 stars. There&#8217;s three more stories in the series right now, but I&#8217;m not sure whether I&#8217;ll read them. Maybe if I can&#8217;t find any other book to read&#8230; Who knows?

Have you read <em>Please Don&#8217;t Tell My Parents I&#8217;m a Supervillain</em>? What are your thoughts on it? Let me know in the comments section!
