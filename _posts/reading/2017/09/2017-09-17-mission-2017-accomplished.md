Of course not. I can&#8217;t do that!

Never!

So of course I will continue reading. But what will I read? When I set my goal, I mentioned some series and books. I&#8217;ve read all those, except for <em>A Head Full of Ghosts</em> by Paul Tremblay. So of course, that&#8217;s one of the books I&#8217;ll be reading in the last quarter of 2017.

What more? I guess I&#8217;ll be continuing series I&#8217;ve already started.

What about you? How far are you in your reading challenge? What are your next books for the remainder of the year? Leave a comment and let me know!
