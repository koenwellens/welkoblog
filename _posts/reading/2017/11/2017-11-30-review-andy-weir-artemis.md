title: 'Review: Andy Weir - Artemis'
description: 'Two books came out this year that I really wanted to read before the end of December. One of those books is <em>Artemis</em>, which is the second book of the author of _The Martian_. I am a big fan of that book, so I was eager to read this one. I finished it just now, so this post is hot off the press!'

<em>Artemis</em> is another step in the galactic path Weir is paving. The first city on the moon. That&#8217;s what the story is about. You heard me! Just like in his first book, Weir proves to be a real humorist. His scientific writing is a real treat.

So is this book good? <b>Yes</b>! For any writer&#8217;s second book, this is a great book! However, Weir&#8217;s first book is _The Martian_. And that sets the bar very high. My expectations were very, _very_ high. And <em>Artemis</em> proved to be a great book. It just didn&#8217;t fulfil my expectations. I can&#8217;t explain it. I think it&#8217;s just a personal thing.

After this book, I am really happy with Weir&#8217;s books. Okay, this one might not have been at the same level as his first, but it&#8217;s still a great book. Therefore, I rate it 4 stars. I wonder how his next books will be. I&#8217;m looking forward to it!
