## The Program

In the beginning of the month, I finished <em>The Program</em>. It&#8217;s the second book of the Tim Rackley series. While I liked the its predecessor, I was let down by this story. <em>The Program</em> has an action-packed plot and the same well-built characters. The protagonist, Tim Rackley, is very arrogant in the beginning of the story. I really hated that.

In case you&#8217;ve read the book, what are your thoughts on it? Leave a comment in the section below.

## Impact Mapping

I went to a conference in Scotland concerning agile and lean, something work related, and received a book as a gift. As a fanatic reader, I gratefully accepted this gift and read it the same day! <em>Impact Mapping</em> shows the basics of the technique and explains how you can use it. Easy examples as well as clear visuals help you as you master the skill.

I liked <em>Impact Mapping</em> because it&#8217;s a useful technique everyone, not only software companies, can use. Have you read the book or are you interested? Leave a comment in the section below!

## The Anatomy of Peace

Ever since I read <em>Leadership and Self-Deception</em>, I&#8217;ve been seeing life differently. I&#8217;ve been constantly evaluating whether I am in my box or not. <em>The Anatomy of Peace</em> has taught me that there&#8217;s so much more to it. Not only can I be in a box, but I can be in one of many kinds of boxes. This is explained through a fictional story where a father undergoes a workshop to help him change, so that his son can change as well.

I am a fan of the Arbinger Institute. They are great at explaining these difficult topics. However, <em>Leadership and Self-Deception</em> gave me a more satisfying feeling. Thus I couldn&#8217;t give this book the same 5 star rating as its predecessor.

## The Silent Corner

It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve read a Dean Koontz story. I always found his stories good, not necessarily great. Certainly not bad. <em>The Silent Corner</em> is a prime example of this. There&#8217;s a lot of action and suspense in this book, while you are thrown in the story. In the beginning, all these things start happening at once. And it might be hard to understand what&#8217;s going on.

The topic of the book is great. It shows the power of Koontz&#8217; writing. I&#8217;ve found out now that this was the first book of a trilogy, so I&#8217;m looking forward to the next books! Have you read it already? What&#8217;s your opinion on it? I&#8217;m guessing by now you know where you can leave it!

## Troubleshooter

Last but not least, I finished <em>Troubleshooter</em> near the end of October. The third instalment of the Tim Rackley series started promising and was well worth the read. Packed with action and suspense, you follow Tim Rackley as he undergoes his hardest battle yet.

You really start to see the first Orphan X hints in this series. Hurwitz is a master at character design and knows how to write a good story! Don&#8217;t you agree? Let me know in the comments section!

## What&#8217;s Next? November 2017

I&#8217;m almost through some series. Might as well use November to finish these storylines. With that in mind, <em>Last Shot</em> of the Tim Rackley series is an easy pick. I&#8217;m also almost through the Arbinger Institute books. I believe there&#8217;s only one left, called <em>The Outward Mindset</em>. I&#8217;d also like to read <em>Paradox Bound</em> which I mentioned earlier, as well as a non-fiction book that I can use at work.

That means I&#8217;ve set my reading goal for November to 4 again! A quick look at my Goodreads stats shows me that if I keep up this pace, I can reach 50 books at the end of December! Isn&#8217;t that incredible? Let&#8217;s do this!
