title: 'Review: Patrick Lencioni - Death by Meeting'
description: 'A few months ago, I read a great book by Patrick Lencioni about what makes or breaks a team. It was one of the best reads I&#8217;ve had this year. So when I found out he had an other book, <em>Death by Meeting</em>, I was eager to read it. It took me some time to get to it, but last weekend it passed my revue. Patrick Lencioni didn&#8217;t let me down.'

A great way to learn something is to see it in action. This isn&#8217;t really possible in a book, but you can give your readers the same experience by telling a tale. That&#8217;s exactly what mr. Lencioni does. First, he explains the problem with meetings in a business fable. The story goes on as the main characters find out what&#8217;s wrong and how they can improve their meetings.

Afterwards, it&#8217;s fairly easy to explain what went wrong and why the chosen solutions made everything better. Patrick Lencioni provides a clear plan to help you fix your meetings. Spoiler alert: it&#8217;s not by having less of them&#8230;

I am a fan of the way Patrick Lencioni writes his books. While the characters in _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_ weren&#8217;t great, the key players in <em>Death by Meeting</em> are worked out a lot better. I like this book. I&#8217;d even recommend it to most people I know. For me, that means this is a 5 star book!
