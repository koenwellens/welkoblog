This year, I read some horror stories. They put me back into the genre. With that in mind, I found <em>Bird Box</em> to be a promising book. I hoped to get spooked. I hoped to read a story that I would want to finish, while on the other hand fear to read further. The latter never happened.

You see, the story is about creatures. And when people see these creatures, they go crazy. And things happen. I won&#8217;t go into detail, but the thing is that you only get this vague idea about monsters. That doesn&#8217;t work for me. They intrigued me. But you get to know <b>nothing</b> about them. <em>Bummer</em>.

Apart from that, the book mainly builds up suspense. And that is a skill Josh Malerman seems to own. Because I didn&#8217;t really want to put the book down. This might also be because I hoped to have some idea about the creatures&#8230; I must admit I also wanted to know what happened to the mentioned characters. About that, I&#8217;m also still left with many questions.

I cannot give this book more than 3 stars. I really like the idea, and I admit that there was no shortage on suspense in this story. But I&#8217;m left with so many questions. Plus I read this with the assumption that it would be a horror book. Which, in my opinion, it wasn&#8217;t. Or not enough, anyway.

Have you read <em>Bird Box</em>? Do you agree with my thoughts or want to share yours? I&#8217;m curious to see what you&#8217;re thinking! Leave a comment in the section below!
