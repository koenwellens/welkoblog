Anyway, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve read in June 2017!

## Missed Opportunity

I added <em>Zeroes</em>, a book about young people with superpowers, to the books I wanted to read in June. I didn&#8217;t get there though. I started reading the book on the 29th, so it was clear for me that I wouldn&#8217;t finish it by the 30th. No problem though, there&#8217;s still July!

## Algorithms to Live By

The first book I finished last month, was <em>Algorithms to Live By</em>. It explains certain software aspects and shows how they can be used in everyday life. The book has some fun facts to read through, but there was a lot of technical talk in it that I already knew.

I think that&#8217;s what I disliked most about the book. But I&#8217;ve learnt some fun things as well. It&#8217;s good to read if you don&#8217;t know anything about computer science. Or has some fun facts to think about when you do. Anyway, find a copy and read it! See for yourself!

## The Nowhere Man

The second book I read in June, was also the second book of the Orphan X series. Evan Smoak returns for an amazing adventure as <em>The Nowhere Man</em>, where he faces off against an enemy like whom he&#8217;s never battled before.

This book is awesome. If you like espionage stories like James Bond or Jason Bourne, read this! Gregg Hurwitz is a master at writing these stories. If you haven&#8217;t already, get this book (or Orphan X if you also haven&#8217;t read that one yet) and read it this year! Because in January, the follow-up book <em>Hell Bent</em> is coming out. I can&#8217;t wait!

## Finders Keepers

After that, I read another second book of a series. This time, it was <em>Finders Keepers</em>. The follow-up book of <em>Mr. Mercedes</em> is another great thriller written by my all-time favourite writer: Stephen King. The story follows Bill Hodges and his team as they stumble across an unbelievable tale.

The story starts a bit slow, but takes you on a kind of flow. Hehe, that rhymes! But it&#8217;s true. What I liked most about this book, is the subtle build-up for the third book in the Bill Hodges trilogy. You can be expecting a review of that book, <em>End of Watch</em>, in August at the latest! If you haven&#8217;t read <em>Mr. Mercedes</em> or <em>Finders Keepers</em>, you really should. These books are great!

## What&#8217;s Next? July 2017

Normally I use this space to tell you what I will read in the next month, but this time there&#8217;s not so much to tell. I&#8217;ve planned holidays in July, so I won&#8217;t be reading at the same pace as normal. I&#8217;ll make a more explaining post about it in the next few days, in which I&#8217;ll also set my July goal.

As for now, go read! And let me know when you find some cool books I might also enjoy!
