### I. Must. Do. Better.

Why? Because in the last two months, I&#8217;ve only written eight posts. That&#8217;s just <b>not good enough</b>. I&#8217;m setting my monthly goal to <em>six</em> blogposts. Let&#8217;s see if I get there.

Also, I&#8217;m restyling my blog. As you can see, there is a <em>new layout</em>. Indeed, I changed it. Why? So that it is clear to you that there are changes. Duh. In the future, I will also change the layout when other changes are due. This to ensure you quickly notice some structural changes.

Secondly, I&#8217;m going to <em>restyle my writing</em>. I followed a course on story telling near the end of April. It was a great course and it let me know that there&#8217;s a lot more to writing than just filling blog posts with words. So you can expect my blog posts to contain more story and less bla-bla.

Last but not least, a friend recently told me that I spoiled too much in my reviews. He was interested to see whether the book was any good. But before he got to that part of my review, he already knew a lot about the content of the novel. And come to think of it, <b>he&#8217;s right</b>.

### I. Spoil. Like. Hell.

It&#8217;s true, damnit. You can expect my reviews to have a <em>different structure</em> in the future. I will do my best to address oncoming spoilers. I&#8217;ll split my review posts into my two cents and my favourite characters. A brief recap of the storyline will probably not be part of my future reviews, unless you want it!

I guess that&#8217;s it. For now, those are the changes that will occur on <em>Reading with @wel_ko</em>. I will keep on sharing my thoughts from my reading corner. Other suggestions or tips to improve are welcome.

Please do <b>not</b> be afraid of the comments section. Last time I checked it didn&#8217;t bite. Any input is deeply appreciated.
