title: 'Review: Patrick Lencioni - The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable'
description: 'Last week I read <em>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable</em>. It&#8217;s a non-fiction book about teamwork and what makes teams fail, but told via a fable. It&#8217;s a fun read and Patrick Lencioni adds cool characters for his story.'

So, what did I think about the book?

In my professional career as a an agile software team member, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time in teams. I&#8217;ve had some good teams and some that just didn&#8217;t seem to work well together. Why was that? I could give some reasons, but never some sort of magical formula about why certain things make teams fall apart. <em>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</em> does exactly that.

Not only does Lencioni discuss the five dysfunctions, he also explains ways to deal with them and strategies to fix issues your team is having. Whether you experience an absence of trust or a lack of commitment, exercises are given in this book to help you get your team back on track.

## Conclusion

I read this book from a non-fiction point-of-view. The fable is a weak story and although Lencioni does his best, some parts are quite predictable. But it does what it is meant to do: explain why some teams have difficulties working together and achieving success. Actually, this book does that perfectly.

For that reason, I rate the book 5 stars.
