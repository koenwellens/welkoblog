title: 'Review: Emilie J. Howard - The Maestro'
description: '<em>Cold Hollow</em> is a city in Vermont, where a lot of things tend to go the wrong way. And I do not mean wrong in a soft way. It&#8217;s a city of parolees, run by an ex-parolee. If necessary, they take the matters in their own hands. One of the least interesting things that happens, is the wedding of the mayor. And that&#8217;s mostly what this story is about&#8230;'

I remember really liking the first book of this series. Even though it was quite short, the story took me back on the horror road. Then I read the second book, which I liked less. Mostly because the series was getting a &#8220;mystery&#8221; kind of vibe, instead of staying true to the horror genre. The third book is less about a mystery, but more some kind of suspense/horror story. Which would be better, if the story would contain suspense.

Something was really missing in this story. There was a lot of information that didn&#8217;t seem to matter much. Most of the story was about Myrna&#8217;s wedding. And it just didn&#8217;t add much to the story. There&#8217;s this small part about the newcomer of the town where we are left in the dark, but this is soon cleared out. Too soon, if you ask me.

## Conclusion

I didn&#8217;t like this book a lot. I liked it better than its predecessor, <em>Weaving the Web</em>, but it just didn&#8217;t catch on to me. I also rate this book 3 stars, because I have hope for the oncoming story in the series: <em>Vengeance</em>. I hope the elements that didn&#8217;t seem to add up to this story, will be used in that one. That&#8217;s all I have for now.

Have you read <em>The Maestro</em>, or another story of the Cold Hollow series? Do you agree with me? Or did you like it more/less? There&#8217;s room for your response in the comments section!
