title: 'Review: Stephen King - Mr. Mercedes'
description: 'I am a Constant Reader. At least, that&#8217;s how Stephen King calls us: the people that keep reading his books, one after the other. I&#8217;ve read a great deal of King books. Like really, a lot of them. But not all of them. Since I am a horror fan, I&#8217;ve waited with the Bill Hodges series as it is more a suspense/thriller story. In any case it&#8217;s not a horror story. Last week, I decided it was time to plunge into it.'

Stephen King has a way of gripping your thoughts until &#8211; <em>and slightly after</em> &#8211; you finish his books. It is the same with <em>Mr. Mercedes</em>. From the first line until the last word, I did not want to put this book down. And after it was finished, I wanted to continue reading. Sadly enough, there were no pages left.

In this first book of the Bill Hodges series, King takes you on a trip along psychothriller lane. There are interesting twists and unexpected events. Characters only come in the story when they are needed, but King does this so profoundly. I have not regretted reading any paragraph of this story.

## Conclusion

Stephen King is a master in making you see life through the eyes of his characters. You see with them, hear with them, eat with them and breathe with them. You&#8217;ll be happy, sad, angry, relieved, scared and so much more. This book provides a rollercoaster of emotions. And best of all, the ending is great!

I rate this book five stars. Not because I am a King fan, but because I wanted to read this one through in one bit for the last time since I read the last work of his son. I am so happy that there are two more books in this series. Let &#8217;em come!
