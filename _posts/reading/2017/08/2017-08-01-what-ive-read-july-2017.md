## Missed Opportunities

I expected to read so many books while on my trip. I had my hopes up for <em>NOS4A2</em> (Hill), <em>Sphere</em> (Crichton), <em>Side Jobs</em> (Butcher) and <em>The Wind Through The Keyhole</em> (King). Of those four books, I hoped to read two. Yet, they are all on the &#8220;maybe later&#8221;-list. I will probably not read those books in August but hey, the year ain&#8217;t over yet!

## Zeroes

Before I left for vacation, I read a book called <em>Zeroes</em>. Young super powered humans find themselves in positions that are rather far-fetched and hard to believe. There was hardly any character build-up. What you did find out, was mostly explained along the way. Oh, and there&#8217;s no villains in this book. Just mobsters and police.

I struggled with finishing this book, so that&#8217;s a first in a long time. I explicitly made a list of reasons to keep reading and to put it down. In the end, the time constraint did it. I finished this book because I wouldn&#8217;t have time enough to finish another (unpacked) book before leaving for Canada. Even though I was disappointed, I&#8217;m glad I finished it. Maybe if someday I get my hopes up again, I can read the rest of this trilogy.

## The Shepherd

At a local book fair last year, I picked up this awesome-looking book: <em>The Shepherd</em>. I know, I know. Don&#8217;t judge a book by it&#8217;s blabla. Still, it appealed to me. I looked it up on Goodreads and because of its rather okay scores, I bought it. And I&#8217;m happy that I did. I had some fun reading this book, about an ex-cop that crosses the roads with a serial killer.

In the end, there were parts of this book that made it feel incomplete. There&#8217;s a lot left open, mostly because this book is the first in a series. Also, I got the feeling that some things were overcomplicated to make them work in the story. There&#8217;s two storylines at the same time here, and that doesn&#8217;t help it. Nevertheless, I&#8217;m looking forward to the second book in the Shepherd series. If you care about crazy serial killer books, you will probably dig this one!

## Horns

While I was resting in a teepee at what the locals called the warmest place of Canada, I had the time to dive into <em>Horns</em>. Now, I know a psychothriller when I read one. And this book definitely is of the sort! This great book shows the early days of Hill&#8217;s work and demonstrates his capabilities in reading the minds of people. It&#8217;s probably in his genes.

There was a part of this book that I could have done without. Probably the background story about Ig was a bit too detailed. But I still like the story very much. You can expect a review of this book very very soon. If you haven&#8217;t read this book already, you definitely should. I suspect it&#8217;s better than the film!

## Micro

In 2008, Michael Crichton unfortunately left the world of the living. As most of us know Crichton, the author of <em>Jurassic Park</em>, he was a fan of biotechnology. None is different in his posthumously published book <em>Micro</em>. This book, that was later finished by Richard Preston, shows a group of doctoral students as they embark on the most dangerous quest mankind has ever faced: micro-world.

Michael Crichton was so good at what he did. He knows how to build up tension and makes you believe the greatest of stories. At some points in the book, there is a lot of technical blabber. That didn&#8217;t stop me from liking it, though! If you haven&#8217;t read it yet, you really, <em>really</em> should. It&#8217;s awesome! Expect a review of it soon.

## Lion

In the airport of Calgary, I found a book that had been on my to-read list for a while now. While I hadn&#8217;t found it in Belgian stores yet, I took the opportunity to purchase it and read it during our flight back. I finished it in one go! I literally couldn&#8217;t put this book down. It&#8217;s just that good.

Saroo Brierley explains the events that happened to him as he gets lost from his family as a five-year old. Twenty-five years later, from the other side of the world, he finds relocates his family and finds out what happened on that night he got lost. It&#8217;s a gripping story that subtly urges you to adopt poor children from countries like India. While I don&#8217;t care much (yet) about the latter, I was really taken aback by this one. It reads like a train. No pun intended&#8230; Don&#8217;t get the pun? Read the book&#8230;

## What&#8217;s Next? August 2017

I&#8217;ve already started reading <em>End of Watch</em>, the third book in Stephen King&#8217;s Bill Hodges trilogy. It&#8217;s verrrrrry promising at this point. There&#8217;s another book, <em>Predictably Irrational</em>, that didn&#8217;t make it on my list for Canada because it&#8217;s non-fiction and I didn&#8217;t want to read non-fiction during my holidays. <em>Kill Clause</em>, however, is a fiction book and I am really looking forward to it. I set my reading goal at those three books. If there&#8217;s enough time, I might read a book called <em>Please Don&#8217;t Tell My Parents I&#8217;m a Supervillain</em>. Admit it, that title looks really promising!
