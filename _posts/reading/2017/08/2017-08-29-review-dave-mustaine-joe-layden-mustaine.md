description: 'This week I got to read the book about Dave Mustaine. What is he like? What is the real story that caused him to form Megadeth? What&#8217;s up with all those lineup changes? There were just too many questions for me, I couldn&#8217;t miss this opportunity. Here&#8217;s what I got from it.'

This book is a memoire by Dave Mustaine himself and reads quite like a train, actually. All those things happening to Dave, or to Megadeth; it makes you wonder whether it&#8217;s not really a fiction story. The book starts off with a nice cliffhanger, which is done really nice by Dave. I&#8217;m very glad with the outcome as I am a fan of Megadeth. If you haven&#8217;t heard them yet, be sure to check them out!

Dave Mustaine is one of a kind. But what&#8217;s funny is that he used to be quite arrogant &#8211; and frankly still is. You can&#8217;t blame him though. I think you become that way in the music industry. Especially in the heavy metal industry. It&#8217;s actually ironic how Mustaine had to fire so many artists, sometimes in a same way as he was fired himself from that other band we&#8217;re not going to name here (if you do want to know, just Google it).

I liked this book. I got some insights in one of my idols. I understand why some actions in his life have happened and why some choices were made. I think I respect him even more after reading this. It got me practicing his songs on guitar again, anyway. Thank you for inspiring people, Dave. You&#8217;re still doing a great job! I give your book 4 stars.
