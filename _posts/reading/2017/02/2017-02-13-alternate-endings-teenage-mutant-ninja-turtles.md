## Some Introduction

Everybody knows the teenage mutant ninja turtles. But what&#8217;s their origin story? This movie shows how the turtles have been created. Four turtles and a rat, Splinter, are test subjects to a project that wants to create an antidote for an extremely poisonous gas. The lab burns down and little April O&#8217;Neil saves the animals and sets them free in the sewers. And that&#8217;s where they remain until this movie starts.

Project Renaissance, as their project was called, was run by Eric Sacks. As the leader of a robotics company, he wants to help The Shredder who runs the Foot Clan. Throughout the movie, Sacks uses April to leed him to the turtles. This way, he can catch them and extract the mutagen from their blood. However, the teenagers escape and engage in an epic fight with The Shredder. He is about to unleash his poisonous gas over the city of New York and it is up to the heroes to stop him.

## The Real Ending

The Shredder sets off a timer of <b>five</b> minutes and starts fighting with the turtles. They fight one on one and four on one. Yet the Shredder always defeats them. Then, they do what Splinter has been trying to teach them: they believe in each other. And by doing so, they attack the Shredder once again, four on one, and defeat him. He falls of the building but is seen to save some of the mutagen as the police surrounds his fallen suit.

## An Alternate Ending

As I&#8217;ve already pointed out in the real ending, the Shredder sets off a timer of five minutes. Really, if you&#8217;re going to poison the city, why give the turtles five minutes to try and stop you? Why don&#8217;t you just release the gas? Okay, he had an agreement with Sacks so that Sacks would survive. However, he doesn&#8217;t look like the kind of guy who keeps promises. So in my alternate ending, he breaks it.

The Shredder unleashes the virus and most of the city of New York is contaminated. It takes the lives of many people. But not everybody. April is a survivor while her ex-colleague Vern Fenwick dies. He is shot by Sacks. April is forced to kill Sacks, but can&#8217;t. Instead, she shoots him in the knee. She takes the mutagen and injects herself with it so that she can survive.

The turtles fight with the Shredder, but he escapes. This is where the second movie can start: New York City recovering from a terrorist attack while the Shredder is out for more mischievous plans.

## Conclusion

My alternate ending is a bit more lugubrious, but would fit the movie more. Other than that, the movie is great. The turtles are really funny, Sacks is the typical bad guy and Megan Fox plays April perfectly. So if you haven&#8217;t seen it yet, you should. It&#8217;s a real good movie.
