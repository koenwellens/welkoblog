title: 'Review: Betty Bohm - Small Talk'
description: 'For a book about <em>small</em> talk, the title <em>Small Talk: How to Connect Effortlessly with Anyone, Strike Up Conversations with Confidence and Make Small Talk Without the Fear of Being Awkward</em> is way too long. Just like the book, which is only 114 pages. Really, there&#8217;s too much text in this.'

## (Very) Brief Recap

This book tries to teach you how to participate in small talk. It explains the concept of small talk and the social reasons why it is important. That&#8217;s it. Nothing more, nothing less. The book shows a lot of scenario&#8217;s describing different sentences in small talk.

## My Two Cents

I read this book with some expectations. Number one, I wanted to learn things about small talk that I didn&#8217;t know yet. Also, I hoped to learn some tips to improve my own small talk skills. Last but not least, I was looking for some reasons why small talk is difficult for certain people. That way, I might be able to use those reasons when I finally write that book I&#8217;ve been dreaming about.

## Conclusion

The book generally gets bad reviews. I have to agree. Most of the things said in this book are common sense. I think the book is great for people with little or no social skills, but for others it is a waste of time. Too bad though, I had high hopes for this one. In my opinion, two stars are all it deserves.
