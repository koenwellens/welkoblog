As announced in my new year&#8217;s resolution, I want to read one book each month that is conform to a theme. What theme? Well, I&#8217;ll choose a new theme each season. Currently, it&#8217;s winter season. And I&#8217;ve decided to go for&#8230;

### &#8230; **books with a <em>blue</em> cover**!

Exactly! You read it right! I&#8217;m going to read at least one book with a blue cover each month. Until the 21st of March, because then I choose the theme for spring!

Get ready for (at least) one book each month that has a blue cover!
