Hi everyone!

Like I mentioned in my last post, July will have a few changes for me.

  * I won&#8217;t be reading at the same pace as usual;
  * I won&#8217;t be blogging.

What does this mean? Will I stop blogging entirely? <b><em>NO!</em></b> I just won&#8217;t have time in the coming month to fill you up on all the books I&#8217;ve read. However, I promise you that I will create posts for all the info you missed out on because of me taking a small break. Expect August to be full with book reviews and more interesting stuff!

As I don&#8217;t know the speed at which I will read, it&#8217;s very hard for me to set a goal. Above are a few of the books I picked. I hope I get to read them all. If I read more, you&#8217;ll find out soon enough!

See you in August, y&#8217;all!
