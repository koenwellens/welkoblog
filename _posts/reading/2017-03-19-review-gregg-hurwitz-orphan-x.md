Don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard but I&#8217;m a Gregg Hurwitz fan. I&#8217;ve read _The Survivor_ and _You&#8217;re Next_ and had this immediate feeling of &#8220;I need to read more of this&#8221;. So, I put <em>Orphan X</em> on my &#8220;Want to Read&#8221; list. I finished it last week. It looks like Gregg Hurwitz has done it again: what a masterpiece.

## Brief Recap

Evan Smoak is a teenager when he gets taken away from his orphanage. His mentor, Jack, helps him master the arts he will need to become the best assassin to serve his country. After learning how to deal with pain and mastering different combat skills, he is let loose on missions that take him over the globe. During his lessons he learns there are other Orphans like him. His codename is **Orphan X**.

During one mission, he gets the feeling he is appointed to kill an innocent man. When afterwards he learns that the man was a human rights activist, he starts to doubt the government he is serving. His next mission is about killing another Orphan. Evan refuses and wants to quit. This sets into motion several events that get Even out of the Orphan program and start his journey as a lone ranger: **The Nowhere Man**.



Evan Smoak has lived his life with his special set of skills and resources to help others. He has become The Nowhere Man, a resource one can call when in dire need. Evan helps the person in need and takes care of those terrorising his/her life. Whenever a person is helped, Evan does not want to be payed. He asks only one thing: that they pass through his number to someone else who is in need of help.

However, when one mission gets him on the radar of the government he has helped for so long, they want to take care of some unfinished business. A web of lies and treachery unwinds around Evan as he learns more about his past, the Orphan program and the values of humanity.

## Characters to Follow

It&#8217;s hard to mention characters to follow for this book. There aren&#8217;t so much characters in it. You&#8217;ll want to follow Evan, as he is a very interesting character. He is a James Bond/Jason Bourne kind of character who has his heart in the right place. He&#8217;s very intriguing. Hurwitz has done an amazing job.

## My Two Cents

<em>Orphan X</em> is a great book for anyone who likes action stories. It involves a well designed plot about modern age assassins. What are they? How do they think? How do they work? You&#8217;ll learn it all in this book.

I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m stressing this out too much, but I _really_ like this book. We live in an age where Bond seems distant because of the technology uprise. Jason Bourne is cool, but he only seems to be a target trying to learn about his past. Evan Smoak on the other hand, has a purpose: he is **The Nowhere Man**. He helps people that are desperate to solve problems they can no longer fix themselves.

## Conclusion

<em>Orphan X</em> is a great opener of a new series. It opens the path of a war between a retired governed assassin and his government. While that war is busy, Evan is busy with his professional life: helping people as The Nowhere Man.

I gave this book 5 stars. It proves once again that Gregg Hurwitz is a master of an art he is forging himself. It&#8217;s a great book and an awesome story. It holds you in a grip. I bet you&#8217;ll want to keep reading this one until it&#8217;s finished.
