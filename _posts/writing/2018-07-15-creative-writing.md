I&#8217;ve had a smaller setback for the book I&#8217;m writing. Long story short: I put the project on hold so that I can give it the full amount of attention it deserves. A small price for a big prize. But that doesn&#8217;t mean I want to stop writing.

### So what now then?



I want to put my current writing project on hold but I don&#8217;t want to put writing itself on hold. So I need to find something that I can still do. Something that doesn&#8217;t take a lot of planning or time. I&#8217;ve come across this idea at multiple websites and platforms. Maybe it&#8217;s time I give it a try.

There&#8217;s this thing called **creative writing**. It&#8217;s what people do when they write a small story based on something. On what exactly? That depends. Some people base it on a photograph. Other people use different techniques.

### Here&#8217;s what I will do

For each week, I will use this website with writing prompts to search for a picture. Then, I will write a small story based on that picture. Let&#8217;s do this weekly thing on Thursdays. So I&#8217;ll see you here next Thursday, with a story about _Outside the Window_.

That&#8217;s all for today. Have fun writing!
