Due to a lot of things asking a lot of time, I’m putting the writing posts on hold for a while. I already know I will not be able to maintain the 1 story per week rhythm so I might as well let you know upfront. I’ll try to chime in a creative writing once in a while, but don’t be surprised if nothing new gets posted here for weeks. I will try to add book reviews though, as I hope to still read during the coming period.

Thank you for your patience!
