This is it! I have created my second blog. On my first, IÂ mentioned that I&#8217;ve started writing again. What does that mean? And why bother you with it anyway?

I mean, come on. It&#8217;s not like I got much to offer. I have no background in writing. I&#8217;ve never written anything longer than a short story. So, what could possible be in this for you?



### My mistakes.

That&#8217;s something, isn&#8217;t it? I want to share with you the process I go through so that you can learn what works and doesn&#8217;t.

Of course, there&#8217;s also something in it for me. I&#8217;ll have a documentary of my writing process. Ain&#8217;t that something to be proud of!

### And so it begins&#8230;

Let&#8217;s see what this turns into. You can expect posts about me pondering fiction ideas, building characters or plainly just writing. Anything that falls in between too.

Unlike on my other blog, I will not keep asking you to comment in every post. But please do so if you want to. Communication is great.

Hope you have fun with this blog. I know I&#8217;m already having a great time writing this post.
