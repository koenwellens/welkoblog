One of the first things I do when I have a story idea, is [write it down][1]. If you don&#8217;t do that yet, start doing it. Get a notebook, download a notebook app or whatever. Doesn&#8217;t matter how you do it. Just put it somewhere.

That&#8217;s the first piece of advice I&#8217;ll give you here. But what then? You put your idea somewhere in some words, some sentences maybe. If it&#8217;s really clear you can have a full paragraph explaining the concept. But that&#8217;s not your novel yet.

### So it is time.



Time to write your first page. But this is not the first page of your novel. Oh no my dear, that is not what you&#8217;re going to write at all. In the beginning, when all you have is some lines about your idea, you need to work it out.

Improve your idea. Think about plot twists. See what can happen. That&#8217;s what I did, and it turned into my first page: an overview of the story. It had some basic information about the protagonist and the main conflict. It had a pretty good idea about the ending too.

So indeed, it is not the first page people will read when reading your novel. At most, you hope people only get to see the content when they open a future Wikipedia page about your future book.

### It is a LIVING summary.

Yeah, I just invented the concept of a living summary. I guess you can compare it with a Wikipedia page. It&#8217;s there. It exists. But it can change. Actually, that&#8217;s what makes it powerful.

Don&#8217;t think that this first page is written in stone. Use it as a guide for your next steps, but feel free to change things whenever you want. Care more for a protagonist of the other gender? Have a better idea about the main conflict? Go ahead. It&#8217;s **your** book.

That&#8217;s all for today. Have fun writing!
