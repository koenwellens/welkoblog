Say what? What is this? Writeception? Kind of. In IT, user stories are a well known concept. I&#8217;m going to give you a simple definition here. For more information and examples, please refer to Mike Cohn&#8217;s blogpost.

In this context, user stories are short, simple descriptions told from the perspective of a reader. They state a clear goal. They express motivation. I don&#8217;t like to describe everything in them, like you might do for your first page, but they should contain these basic concepts.

### Some examples



> As a reader, I want to learn the background of the protagonist so that I better understand his motivation.
> 
> As a reader, I want to meet the antagonist&#8217;s friends so that I can fully appreciate the person he is. Instead of just seeing him as the bad guy.
> 
> As the protagonist, I want to learn more about person X, so that the information I&#8217;ve gathered can help me to pursuit goal Y.

These are very high-level examples. Mostly because if I use my own, I might be spoiling half my story. But I think you get the general idea, right?

### Still with me?

I try to write this kind of user stories for each chapter. Each chapter should have a goal. If it doesn&#8217;t, then what&#8217;s the use of it? The goal can be for the reader, as well as for characters in the book.

The motivation shouldÂ **always** be in connection to the plot. Whether it&#8217;s about gaining knowledge in the motivation and thus the conflict of a character, or whether it helps the character and/or reader move forward in the story.

I&#8217;ll let you know how this experiment works out. If you want to try it, go ahead. I think the extra information doesn&#8217;t hurt.

That&#8217;s all for today. Have fun writing!
