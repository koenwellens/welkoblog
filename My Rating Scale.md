## My Rating Scale
Since January 2018, I&#8217;ll use the scale below to rate my books. If you have feedback, just let me know! I do my best to adapt to change ASAP.

 ✩ - I couldn&#8217;t even finish this book. Ugh. I wouldn&#8217;t even accept this if I received it as a gift.

 ✩✩ -  Wtf? What was wrong with this author? Okay, I finished the book. That doesn&#8217;t mean I get it. Or like it.

 ✩✩✩ -  Meh. This book was okay-ish. I&#8217;ve read better books. I also read worse. Probably not worth reading again someday, though.

 ✩✩✩✩ - This book was cool. I could talk about it if you want me to. I&#8217;ll provide you with details and recommend it to you, if it&#8217;s the kind of books you like.

 ✩✩✩✩✩ -  Wow. This. Book. Is. <b>AWESOME!</b> I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s over. OMG. Can&#8217;t I start reading it again? I must talk about this book. To everyone! It&#8217;s so amazing!
