# Disclaimer

Some words need to be said about certain things you might see on this blog. 

### Content
If I refer to other content - <em>read: copy-paste or quote something</em> - I will always mention the source unless I am quoting out of a book during a book review. In that case, the title of the post should point you to the author who's the owner of the content.

### Images
I hardly ever take pictures myself. On this blog, however, you will find plenty. Where do they come from?
- Images for book covers taken from Goodreads.
- Other images found from free websites like Pexels, Pixabay, Unsplash.
- Images from the creative writing series can also be taken from Google Images. In this case, the picture will link through to the original website where it was posted. All credits to them.

### Comments
I use disqus for comments on this blog. You can request to have your comments removed at any time.

### Blog
I did not write all the code for this blog myself. I kind of started from the <a href="https://github.com/thiagorossener/jekflix-template">jekflix-theme</a>. Then I tweaked it to my likings. So all credits for the theme go to <a href="http://www.rossener.com" target="_blank" class="creator">Thiago Rossener</a>

### Found something that was missing?

If I have forgotten someone, please let me know. It was not on purpose!
