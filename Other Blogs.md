## Other Blogs

Where there&#8217;s one, there&#8217;s more. Here&#8217;s a list of blogs that might interest you.

### <a href="http://thoth-amon.blogspot.com/">WRITER on WRITING</a>

Peter Clines has a blog called WRITER on WRITING. It&#8217;s full of tips from a writer&#8217;s point of view, with many pop-culture references, cool pictures and writer rantings. Check it out!

### <a href="https://whatever.scalzi.com/">Whatever</a>

Ever heard of this blog? It&#8217;s John Scalzi&#8217;s! There&#8217;s a lot of different topics here. Sometimes he posts pictures, or reports from events he attended. Sometimes there&#8217;s personal opinions or his series of Big Ideas. Be sure to go there and have a look.

### <a href="http://oanasagile.blogspot.com/">Agile Thoughts and Things</a>

Care about agile? Then do I know a blog for you. Oana Juncu is pretty well-known in the world of software development as she gives many talks about different topics. She doesn&#8217;t post a lot on her blog, but when she does it is worth it.

### <a href="https://www.bakadesuyo.com/">Barking Up the Wrong Tree</a>

After reading his book, I spent some time learning more about Eric Barker. Turns about he too maintains a blog. It&#8217;s filled with a lot of self-improvement tips as well as books to read. Make sure to visit this one.

### <a href="https://shirleycuypers.blogspot.com/">Shirley Cuypers</a>

There is this Belgian girl who spends a lot of time blogging, promoting books and living the social media life. She owns a blog where she discusses books, lifestyle and make-up. While the last two don&#8217;t interest me a lot, I appreciate the time she takes for writing posts about books. By the way, she made a list of book bloggers. I&#8217;m on there too. Yay!

### <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/blog/index">The Goodreads Blog</a>

Goodreads is one of my favourite websites. Not only do I find out about books there, I am able to track my progress, list books and connect with other people. And they have a blog. They post a lot of book lists and have great book contests. Be sure to check them out as well!
