## The @wel_ko Manual

Hi, I&#8217;m @wel_ko. In 2017, I read _How Google Works_. One of the things I&#8217;ve learnt from the book is that someone created a manual for his colleagues on how to interact with him. This spiked the idea to create this page. Here&#8217;s a short manual on me.

### Respect & Friendliness


  Any human deserves respect. Without it, we cannot work together. No accomplishments, no reached goals. This is the baseline for working together.

  Nobody ever died from being friendly. It never hurts either. I firmly believe that friendliness is a first step in making the world a better place. Don’t we all want that?


### Openness & Transparency


  The truth can hurt. Backing up the truth with data and well-thought-through follow-up plans can improve us on the long run. I believe being open provides a much better way of working together.

  I’m a fan of being transparent to people. Is something not going as planned? You might already see it when you walk around my workstation or notice it when you talk to me. Being transparent invites others to think about problems you might not be able to solve in your own. Together we can achieve so much more.


### Teamwork & Collaboration


  Teamwork makes the dream work. It’s a saying that I completely agree with. Teamwork is not possible without collaboration. I believe we can achieve so much if we collaborate, providing feedback to one another in a polite and respectful way.


### Clarification & Visualisation


  Is something not clear? Or are we not sure about something? Maybe we need to clarify it. Numbers and statistics are easily misused, but they can show you what is going on. Data FTW!


  What else can you do with numbers and statistics? Visualisation! You can use data to visualise problems or issues you are having. For instance, can’t get your task done? Provide a clear way to show others that you are still working on the same task.


### Feedback & Opinion

  Both matter to me and I give them frequently. Don’t hesitate to give yours to me.

  I also appreciate it if you tell me I’m being to direct. I have a way of doing that. That’s no problem, just something I can improve on.
