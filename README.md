# The welko blog

## What is it?

A blog where I review books and ramble about writing. Maybe other stuff as well!

## Running local

In order to compile the assets and run Jekyll on local you need to follow those steps:

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (remember to use the latest version)
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm install -g gulp gulp-cli`
- Open `_config.yml` and change to:
```
baseurl: ""
url: ""
```
- Run `gulp`

## Socials Settings

You have to fill some informations on `_config.yml` to customize the socials on your site.

```
# Social Media settings
# Remove the item if you don't need it
github_username: github_username
facebook_username: facebook_username
twitter_username: twitter_username
instagram_username: instagram_username
linkedin_username: linkedin_username
medium_username: medium_username
```

## Creating drafts

You can use the `initdraft.sh` to create your new drafts. Just follow the command:

```
./initdraft.sh -c Post Title
```

The new file will be created at `_drafts` with this format `date-title.md`.

## Creating posts

You can use the `initpost.sh` to create your new posts. Just follow the command:

```
./initpost.sh -c Post Title
```

The new file will be created at `_posts` with this format `date-title.md`.

## Front-matter 

When you create a new post, you need to fill the post information in the front-matter, follow this example:

```

layout: post
title: "Welcome"
